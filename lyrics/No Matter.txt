作詞：K.Toom/M.Karmas作曲：K.Toom/M.Karmas編曲：陳偉A smile upon your face　And feathers dance in graceYour thousand kisses　This is our time and spaceForever as no pace　What if this isA moment and a place　For lovers in a haste?See what bliss is　If this is all we haveTomorrow we must go　You should knowI don't care at all　wherever you want to goI'll feel at homeNo matter through the rise or fallThrough every bend　Until the endCause darling, I don't care at allWhatever life has in store　I'll ask no more更多更詳盡歌詞 在 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 No matter how tomorrow calls　Time made a vowForever nowFire-flies in the air　The fever drawing nearBefore the love strikesSomeone has lit the starsAnd shadows mold the scars　In the moonlightBut only here we are　Unbroken driven farFrom the first timeIF this is all we have　Tomorrow we must goWhen we awake to the morning and breakThe moment, then repentAnd then confused, feeling, something's been bruisedWe must go, but you'll know
