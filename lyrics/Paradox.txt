Lyrics：陳潔儀Music：BoxArranger：Case WooI want my pearls & diamondsI want my fancy carI want a love that bruns me upI want some cuts & scarsYou said you can hold meYou'll make me warm & sweetWill you still recognize me whenI'm torn up & imcompleteWhat will become of meWill you wait around to see?What will become of meWill you wait around to see?更多更詳盡歌詞 在 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 Never found a place to keep meThe darkness calls like a bansheeJust when the bed is warm & readyI'm struggling to be free＃What will become of meWill you wait around to see?What will become of meWill you wait around to see?I want my pearls and diamondsI want some cuts & scarsRepeat ＃
