Lyrics：陳潔儀Music：BoxArranger：Case WooLife is so simpleWhen you know how to be freeShackles & chains, locks & keysAre just part of your sick fantasyWhy do you call me a silly childJust because you've forgotten how to playWhy do you have to shout so loudWhen you have nothing to sayHow much money you must maketo feel you've made itHow many hours you have gone byThat you weren't living itWhen love comes knockingWill you embrace itAnd when it's all over更多更詳盡歌詞 在 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 Will you know itWhy must we all have labelsLike life forms in twisted bottlesIS it just because we're so afraidThat we'll simply evaporateBetter wake upBefore you miss itHey, you better wake upBefore you miss itWake upHey, better wake upWake up.
