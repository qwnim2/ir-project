作詞：蔡健雅作曲：蔡健雅All the sadness in the airHow did we get to this?Why did we end this way?All the things we used to shareYou said put them all awayClose my eyes they're still there yeahStill trying to understandTrying the best I canTo start over again ohChorus:If who I am brings you not joy but tears babeI cannot bear to see you fighting with this pain更多更詳盡歌詞 在 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 So I wish you all the bestIf we can't be loversMaybe we can still be friendsThough we never really knewWhy did our worlds collideThere were no reasons whyWhen we're meant to say goodbyeYou were never really mineYou were just a state of mindStill trying to understandTrying the best I canTo start over again oh 感謝 笨狗  提供歌詞
