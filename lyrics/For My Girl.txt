Lyrics：陳潔儀Music：BoxArranger：Case Woo/Gary LeoRemember when a dream was all you've gotYet it made you happy, you didn't need muchIt's not true that life gets more complicatedIt's the people that got more screwed up＊I know I'll miss you but I can't stand still　The world's before me beyond that hill　The unknown is beckoning, daring me to try　It's time to stretch these wings, and fly.＃This song is for my girl　Wherever you are　I hope you can be brave　And don't chicken out更多更詳盡歌詞 在 ※ Mojim.com　魔鏡歌詞網 　This song is for my girl　You know who you are　This ain't goodbye　I'm just checking outHey, I've been there & I know it's roughYou're still so young but you feel burnt outBut baby, living a lie is much more toughThrow caution to the wind & don't give upRepeat ＊,＃The unknown is beckoning, daring me to tryIt's time to stretch these wings, and fly.Repeat ＃
