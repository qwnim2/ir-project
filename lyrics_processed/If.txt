LyricsDavid GatesMusicDavid GatesIf a man could be two places at one time Id be withyouTomorrow and today beside you all the wayIf the world should stop revolving spinning slowlydown to dieId spend the end with youAnd when the world wasthroughThen one by one the stars would all go outand you and I would simply fly awayIf a picture paints a thousand wordsThen why cant I paint youThe words will never showthe you Ive come to knowif a face could launch a thousand shipsThen where am I to goTheres no one home but youYoure all thats left metoo And when my love for life is running dryYou come and pour yourself on meIf a man could be two places at one time Id be withyouTomorrow and today beside you all the wayIf the world should stop revolving spinning slowlydown to dieId spend the end with youAnd when the world wasthroughThen one by one the stars would all go outand you and I would simply fly awayIf如果有人可以同時身處兩地　我願與你同在無論明日今日長伴你左右如果世界停止轉動　慢慢停止希望能陪你到老　直至世界末日星辰的閃爍逐漸熄滅你我將比翼雙飛如果畫能繪出千言萬語為何我無法彩繪出你的影像千言萬語無法說出　我所認識的你如果臉上的表情可以載滿所有的負荷起航那我該何去何從心中只有你　停留在我心裡當我此生的愛漸漸枯萎你前來將愛傾注我心中如果人可以同時身處兩地　我願與你同在無論明日今日長伴你左右如果世界停止轉動　慢慢停止希望能陪你到老　直至世界末日星辰的閃爍逐漸熄滅你我將比翼雙飛
