作詞于文文作曲于文文Yesterday I met a guy dont even know his nameOf course I tried to play it coolBut it only fanned the flameI feel like a foolDont like to play the game with all your rulesDont wanna think about you night and dayBut I do anywayha    ha You make me wanna try every possible dayha   haNo easy love ever made me feel this wayI feel like a foolDont like to play the game with all your rulesDont wanna think about you night and dayBut I will anywayha    ha    ha    haSinging I feel alive feel alive Thinking I could survive could surviveBaby I got it wronggot it wrongCause it all goes around goes aroundoh come on and save meShow me you love mePromise you wont leave meThrow your arms around mehold mesave meYou got me cravingYou know what I needCome on and save me   save meha  ha  ha   haSave meYou got me cravingYou know what I needCome on and save me  save me
