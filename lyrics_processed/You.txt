前身是靠邊停Shes waitingHes lyingFor the moment of truth hes hidingSo maybeHe told meIm not your perfect oneIm sorryFor reallyThere is greater a chance well grow wearySo goodbyeIn my eyes they cried September rainWhy did the sky above me look so down in sorrowWhen they said it was supposed to be blueI used to Be wiserNow the fact that Im headingIm hopingYoud tell meYou need me by your sideWith my heartThough were apartThere a beauty of love inside meForever itll never leave me till I dieSo how am I supposed to live my lifePretending that there wad nothing about me and youYet there is nothing to doIn June Ill think about you
