LyricsIrving BerlinMusicIrving BerlinIm dreaming of a white ChristmasJust like the ones I used to knowWhere the trees tops glisten and children listenTo hear sleigh bells in the snowIm dreaming of a white ChristmasWith every Christmas card I writeMay your days be merry and brightAnd may all your Christmas be white Im dreaming of a white ChristmasJust like the ones I used to knowWhere the tree tops glisten and children listenTo hear sleigh bells in the snowIm dreaming of a white ChristmasJust like the ones I used to knowMay your days be merry and brightAnd may all your Christmas be write
