作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅Ill never forgetEverything he saidTrust in me Ill be your manOh babe you wont regretAnd Ill take care of youIll buy a big house just for twoYou never have to be alone againThat was what he saidTo me after we metLettin my defenses downI chose to take a chanceCos I wanted to believeIve found someone to be dependMy heart will never be broken againTill he walked away ChorusSo from now onIll carry onLive like weve neverNever loved beforeFrom now onIll carry onLive like weve never met beforeLive like weve never met beforeThough he didnt stayHis words still remainTo remind I once believeHow good things couldve beenBut good things never stayTheyre just like a one night standYou wake up in the morningWith a case full of regrets
