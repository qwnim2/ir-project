作詞陳潔儀作曲陳潔儀編曲Case WooIt was always easy to miss youThere among the shadows in the crowdYou were soft but I knew youTo be unbreakable infallibleAlmostIt was really more than just a jokeYoure my constant Northern Star I fearIm the wanderer expectingMy strength to always be there when I lookMy good friendOh my dear friend Will you cry on my sleevesCan the wanderer start to lead the star Under all the false smile and the cheerWas the truth that melted my smileInto sorry tears of painYou said you were trapped inside your wellOf loneliness that none can ever reachYour web of depression Your bitter pillsAnd a sadness overcame me Ive neglected youMy good friendIs it too late for me to start giving what Ive always takenOh my dear friend Will you cry on my sleeveso I can say that its alright cos I am hereCan the wanderer start to lead the starLet the wanderer start to lead the star這真的不只是個笑話我的力量總是在那裡　當我想看我的好友喔　我親愛的朋友　妳會在我的袖子上哭泣嗎當時這些字義隱藏在所有的假裝的微笑和鼓勵之下卻是真實熔解我的笑容卻是真實熔解我的笑容變成疼痛的道歉淚水妳說妳被困在妳自己的孤單之井　而無人可及妳的沮喪織網　妳的苦口療藥悲傷重創我　我竟然忽略了妳我的好友現在給妳我過去巧奪的那些太遲了嗎喔　我親愛的朋友　妳會在我的袖子上哭泣嗎讓我因而可說沒關係因為我在這裡流浪者可以開始引領星星嗎讓流浪者引領星星吧
