好想放假原曲Today its gonna be okayCos the fortune teller said soSo I think its safe to go outPut on my finest pair of shadesPack my bags IllGo west to the seasideWho cares if its gonna rain or shineCos the fortune teller said soSo theres nothing else that could go wrongSo what if no one even caresPack my bads IllGo up the mountainsDa da da If you feel the same as I do Come with meMaybe Im just a little scaredNeurotic paranoids my nameEveryone has their own reasonsFeeling a little insecureGuess Ill need a breakOr change of seasonsMaybe its gonna be okayCos for so long Ive felt so downEverything just had to go wrongTill now the fortune teller siadThat from now on its luckThat will come my way
