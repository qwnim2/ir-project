On this earthUnder the deep blue seaAnd in the skyThats where youll find my hart  soulThats where youll my precious loveIf you wanna have it you know where to findIn your heartIn your eyes In your mindAnd in your lifeThats where I know I wanna beThats where I know that I belongIf I were blindfolded Id still know where to go I know I love youYou adore meThink our love is heaven sentBut the worlds seen so cruel thatWe dont know whats gonna lastI know I love youYou adore meBut would our love find the strengthI cant help but to wonder where do we go from here
