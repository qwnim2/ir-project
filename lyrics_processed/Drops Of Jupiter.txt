LyricsTanya ChuaMusicTanya ChuaArtistTanya Chuanow that shes back in the atmosphereWith drops of jupiter in her hair hey heyShe acts like summer and walks like rainReminds me that theres time to change hey heySince the return from her stay on the moonShe listens like spring and she talks like june hey heyTell me did you sail across the sunDid you make it to the milky way to see the lights all fadedAnd that heaven is overratedTell me did you fall for a shooting starOne without a permanent scarAnd did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out thereNow that shes back from that soul vacationTracing her way through the constellation hey heyShe checks out mozart while she does taeboReminds me that theres room to grow hey hey Now that shes back in the atmosphereIm afraid that she might think of me as plain ol janeTold a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did landTell me did the wind sweep you off your feetDid you finally get the chance to dance along the light of dayAnd head back to the milky wayAnd tell me did venus blow your mindWas it everything you wanted to findAnd did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out thereCan you imagine no love pride deepfried chickenYour best friend always sticking up for you even when i know youre wrongCan you imagine no first dance freeze dried romance fivehour phoneConversationThe best soy latte that you ever had    and meTell me did the wind sweep you off your feetDid you finally get the chance to dance along the light of dayAnd head back toward the milky wayRepeat st chorus
