Ive heard there was a secret chordThat David played and it pleased the LordBut you dont really care for music do youIt goes like thisThe fourth the fifthThe minor fall the major liftThe baffled king composing HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahYour faith was strong but you needed proofYou saw her bathing on the roofHer beauty in the moonlight overthrew youShe tied you to a kitchen chairShe broke your throne and she cut your hairAnd from your lips she drew the HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahBaby I have been here beforeI know this room Ive walked this floorI used to live alone before I knew youIve seen your flag on the marble archLove is not a victory marchIts a cold and its a broken HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahThere was a time when you let me knowWhats really going on belowBut now you never show it to me do youAnd remember when I moved in youThe holy dove was moving tooAnd every breath we drew was HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah Hallelujah Maybe theres a God aboveBut all Ive ever learned from loveWas how to shoot at someone who outdrew youIts not a cry you can hear at nightIts not somebody who has seen the lightIts a cold and its a broken HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahYou say I took the name in vainI dont even know the nameBut if I did well really whats it to youTheres a blaze of light in every wordIt doesnt matter which you heardThe holy or the broken HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahI did my best it wasnt muchI couldnt feel so I tried to touchIve told the truth I didnt come to fool youAnd even though it all went wrongIll stand before the Lord of SongWith nothing on my tongue but HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah HallelujahHallelujah
