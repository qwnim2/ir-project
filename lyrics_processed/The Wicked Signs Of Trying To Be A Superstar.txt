I thought I heard my nameAs I walked along the streets I felt strangeSomebodys watchin my faceAnd now my life will never be the sameAm I somebody changedCause without no makeup on I feel shameNo you cant smoke or swearNow my life will never be the sameCould these be the wicked signsOf tryin be a superstarCould these be the wicked signsWould you like an autograph of mine Everyday starving myselfCos I gotta be a prefect size Try beat a pimple raceNow my life will never be the sameI thought I heard my nameAs I walked along the streets I felt strangeSomebodys watchin my faceAnd now my life will never be the sameBa da daMy life will never be the sameBa da daMy life will never be the same
