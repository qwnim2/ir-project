作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅Was it just your fears orJust a fact that INeeded you more than you needed meNow I finally see thatIt was not your faultJust that weve come to the endCame without a warningLeft without a soundCame and turned my whole world inside outNow I finally see thatIt was meant to beNow that weve come to the endOh this loveTook a thousand ridesOn a big spinning carousel We took our final ride on the carouselGotta keep believingIt was just bad timingNeither one of us wanted to leaveThough its hard to see thatWeve come to an endLeast I knew that we once lovedOh this loveTook a thousand ridesOn a big spinning carouselWe took our final ride on the carouselOh this loveWasnt made to last so they sayWhen everything felt rightStill kept falling apartDespite how hard we tried
