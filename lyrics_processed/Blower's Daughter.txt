And so it is just like you said it would beLife goes easy on memost of the timeAnd so it is the shorter storyNo love no gloryNo hero in her skyI cant take my eyes off youI cant take my eyes off youI cant take my eyes off youI cant take my eyes off youI cant take my eyes off youI cant take my eyesAnd so it is just like you said it should beWell both forget the breezeMost of the timeAnd so it is the colder water The Blowers DaughterThe pupil in denialDid I say that I loathe youDid I say that I want toLeave it all behindI cant take my mind off youI cant take my mind off youI cant take my mind off youI cant take my mind off youI cant take my mind off youI cant take my mindmy mindmy mindTil I find somebody new
