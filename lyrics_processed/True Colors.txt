You with the sad eyesDont be discouragedOh I realizeIts hard to take courageIn a world full of peopleYou can lose sight of it allAnd the darkness inside youCan make you feel so smallBut I see your true colorsShining throughI see your true colorsAnd thats why I love youSo dont be afraid to let them showYour true colorsTrue colors are beautifulLike a rainbow Show me a smile thenDont be unhappy cant rememberWhen I last saw you laughingIf this world makes you crazyAnd youve taken all you can bearYou call me upBecause you know Ill be thereAnd Ill see your true colorsShining throughI see your true colorsAnd thats why I love youSo dont be afraid to let them showYour true colorsTrue colors are beautifulLike a rainbow
