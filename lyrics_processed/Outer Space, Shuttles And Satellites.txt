Where should I beginTo tell you everything that I shouldShould I start it with a summaryAnd later on one truth and ten liesBecause simply becauseIll open up and closed down on youThat I start to believe that it seemsThat its okay to be so unkindRight before you came along I didnt realizeThere is so much for me to look outPacing back and forth between the shadows and lightsI can see the sun coming out finallyDid you see me cryAnd when you asked whats wrong I said nothingI laughed too hard at the joke on TVAnd that was how we ended the night How long has it beenWith all that bullshit I put you throughI dont even think youll forgive all my sinsSo should I keep them all to myselfYou are what you are someone that I dont deserveIt can no longer serve as a reminderDreaming bout outer space shuttles and satellitesTake me far awaySomeone far away from hereIll pack my bag Ill goIll bear my own sorrowIts easier when theresNo one left to blameTo turn the lights on and off on and off
