作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅Hey I dont think I got your nameI dont even know where you stayWhere you stayOh heyDont you think it might be fateHow we met on a boring dayYeah its fateChorusI dont know whether if Id ever see you againBut Id sure like to try to see you once again Whether if we would make it as lovers or friendsI wish on a starSo I could see you againHey I think about you everydayI say my prayers say my graceSay them loud loudOoh heyI cant forget your handsome faceIts a sweet and bitter tasteSweet and bitter taste
