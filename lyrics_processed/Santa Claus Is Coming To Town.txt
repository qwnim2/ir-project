WrittenFred CootsHaven GillespieFeaturing蟑螂范曉萱You better watch outYou beter not cryYou better not poutIm telling you whySanta Claus is coming to townSanta Claus is coming to townSanta Claus is coming to townHes making a listHes checking it twice Hes gonna find outWhos naughty or niceHe sees when youre sleepingHe knows when youre awakeHe knows if youve been bad or goodSo be good for goodness sakeWith little horns and little toy drumsRooty toot toots and rummy turn turnsAnd curly head dolls that toddle and cooElephants boats and kiddie cars too
