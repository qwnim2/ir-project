Lately Ive been feeling kinda far awayDays are nights how Im awareThat everythings turning upside down ohStrangely I have found myself a friend insdeA friend too kind how Im awareThat everythings turning inside outThe wall around me keeps on fallingDespite of it all I dont whySuddenly it all came to meThat it couldve been the fact I wanna break freeFunny how I used to be so scaredOh how Ive changed my mindNow that everythings turning inside outIm tired of this city lifeInstead of going right Ill take a left this timeOh Ill even try to beat the lights
