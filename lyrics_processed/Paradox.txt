Lyrics陳潔儀MusicBoxArrangerCase WooI want my pearls  diamondsI want my fancy carI want a love that bruns me upI want some cuts  scarsYou said you can hold meYoull make me warm  sweetWill you still recognize me whenIm torn up  imcompleteWhat will become of meWill you wait around to seeWhat will become of meWill you wait around to see Never found a place to keep meThe darkness calls like a bansheeJust when the bed is warm  readyIm struggling to be free＃What will become of meWill you wait around to seeWhat will become of meWill you wait around to seeI want my pearls and diamondsI want some cuts  scarsRepeat ＃
