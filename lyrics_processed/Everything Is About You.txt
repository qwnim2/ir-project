Had enough of hanging aroundThere must be something else to doYou cant seem to stop whining aboutHow lifes been so unfair to youOh baby baby Im Im loveBut not with you with someone elseYoure maybe maybe unconcernedCos everythings bout you everything is about youUnderstand its me not youIts me who cant seem to be trueCant go on living in a lieYou didnt live up to expectations Since the day youve entered my houseShe become so old and wearyWrinkled all my sheets and my faceThere are just among the other thingOh enough enough of hanging aroundThere must be something else to doNo this cant go on this cant be allowedIm not a slave to you condescensionDu du duthere are just among other things
