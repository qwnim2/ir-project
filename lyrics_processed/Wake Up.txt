Lyrics陳潔儀MusicBoxArrangerCase WooLife is so simpleWhen you know how to be freeShackles  chains locks  keysAre just part of your sick fantasyWhy do you call me a silly childJust because youve forgotten how to playWhy do you have to shout so loudWhen you have nothing to sayHow much money you must maketo feel youve made itHow many hours you have gone byThat you werent living itWhen love comes knockingWill you embrace itAnd when its all over Will you know itWhy must we all have labelsLike life forms in twisted bottlesIS it just because were so afraidThat well simply evaporateBetter wake upBefore you miss itHey you better wake upBefore you miss itWake upHey better wake upWake up
