原唱范曉萱作詞黃國倫作曲黃國倫青春若有張不老的臉　但願它永遠不被改變許多夢想總編織太美　跟著迎接幻滅愛上你是最快樂的事　卻又換來最痛苦的悲苦澀交錯愛的甜美　我怎樣都學不會哦　眼淚　眼淚都是我的體會　成長的滋味哦　眼淚　忍住眼淚不讓你看見哦　我在改變　孤單的感覺　你從不曾發現　我笑中還有淚愛上你是最快樂的事　卻又換來最痛苦的悲苦澀交錯愛的甜美　我怎樣都學不會哦　眼淚　眼淚都是我的體會　成長的滋味哦　眼淚　忍住眼淚不讓你看見哦　我在改變　孤單的感覺　你從不曾發現　我笑中還有淚哦　眼淚　眼淚流過無言的夜　心痛的滋味哦　眼淚　擦乾眼淚忘掉一切　曾有的眷戀哦　眼淚是苦　眼淚是傷悲　哦　眼淚都是你哦　眼淚是甜　眼淚是昨天　哦　眼淚不流淚 If youth got an ageless face then I wish that it will never be changedThere are too many dreams that were built up to look greatbut then we will have to accept that they got destroyedFalling in love with you is the happiest thingbut in exchanged it also bought along the deepest painBitterness mixed with the sweetness of love I will never learnWo tears tears are what I learned the taste of growth upWo tears holding the tears so that you wouldnt see it WoI am changing the feeling of lonelinessso that you will not noticed that there are tears in my smileFalling in love with you is the happiest thingbut in exchanged it also bought along the deepest painBitterness mixed with the sweetness of love I will never learnWo tears tears are what I learned the taste of growth upWo tears holding the tears so that you wouldnt see it WoI am changing the feeling of lonelinessso that you will not noticed that there are tears in my smileWo tears tears float on speechless night the feeling of painWo tears wiping dry the tears forget everything the love that I once haveWo tears are bitter tears are sadnessWo tears are you Wo tears are sweet tears are yesterdayWo tears stop crying
