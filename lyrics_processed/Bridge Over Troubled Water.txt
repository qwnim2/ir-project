作詞Paul Simon作曲Paul SimonWhen youre wearyFeeling smallWhen tears are in your eyesI will dry them allIm on your sideWhen times get roughAnd friends just cant be foundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downWhen youre down and outWhen youre on the streetWhen evening falls so hardI will comfort youIll take your part When darkness comesAnd pain is all aroundLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downLike a bridge over troubled waterI will lay me downSail on Silver GirlSail on byYour time has come to shineAll your dreams are on their waySee how they shineIf you need a friendIm sailing right behindLike a bridge over troubled waterI will ease your mindLike a bridge over troubled waterI will ease your mind
