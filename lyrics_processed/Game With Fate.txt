作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅Therell be days when everything dont go your wayGot no one to blameIts just the moon and stars that have gone out of lineIts gonna be okayIts as if the world always walk out on youWhen you needed faithSuch a cross to bear not to cry about itBut youll be okayChorus Cos its only a game with fateYou lose some youll gainIts all about how you playSo play it cool with graceThen maybe one dayYoull end up winning this gameYou can keep on givingBut in the end getNothing in returnBut dont overanalyze theyre just lessons to learnKeep telling yourself
