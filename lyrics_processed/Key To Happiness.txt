作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅Youre losing your mindEverything seems to be falling apartTears trapped in your eyesYou swallow them down to fill up your heartBut take a look aroundYou dont have to feel downHappiness is round the cornerSavor all the sweetnessLose all your bitternessMaybe thats the key to happinessYeah yeahShake off some saltinessBear with the sournessThats half of the key to happinessKey to happinessYoure dying insideLike a flower thats been kept in the darkEmpty is your soul Nothings working to fill it up enoughThough fuck ups are aboundThere is still hope somehowSo let it surround you babySavor all the sweetnessLose all your bitternessYoull find thats the key to happinessYeah yeahShake off some saltinessBear with the sournessThats half of the key to happinessKey to happinessBut dont side step itTheres no detour round itBet youve been scratching your headBut why side step itWhen theres a road aheadTheres a big sign pointing to it
