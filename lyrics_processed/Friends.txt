作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅All the sadness in the airHow did we get to thisWhy did we end this wayAll the things we used to shareYou said put them all awayClose my eyes theyre still there yeahStill trying to understandTrying the best I canTo start over again ohChorusIf who I am brings you not joy but tears babeI cannot bear to see you fighting with this pain So I wish you all the bestIf we cant be loversMaybe we can still be friendsThough we never really knewWhy did our worlds collideThere were no reasons whyWhen were meant to say goodbyeYou were never really mineYou were just a state of mindStill trying to understandTrying the best I canTo start over again oh
