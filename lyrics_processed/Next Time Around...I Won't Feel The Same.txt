Whod ever thought you would misunderstandIts always the case you were right I was wrongI think its true that I should have a planIf you do that again its goodbyeCould it be that we were not meant to beIve cried enough tears to fill up a big seaBut Im not the kind to live on miseryYet I dont want to be part of you historyIve tried to get close to youIve been by your side But its always the case that Ive never been trueIf nothing else works for you well meet againBut next time aroundNo I wont be the sameFinally its time that I turn off the lightsLeave all behind thats yours and take what mineTry not to call or come ringing your bellCos its something to do with my pride
