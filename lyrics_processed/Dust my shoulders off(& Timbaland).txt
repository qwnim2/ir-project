作詞Jim BeanzKirbyJane Zhang作曲Jim BeanzTimbalandJust had a bad dayHad car trouble on the highwayAnd my stupid boss dont like meSpilled hot coffee on my blue jeansIm low on moneyAnd it aint funnyBut its still sunny outsideSo I keep on smilingI wont start wailingI just keep living my lifeCant keep me down me downIts only temporaryCant make me frown me frownSo I aint even worriedCause the world keep spinningLife goes on and onI wont cry for longCause it still be winningWhen things are going wrongI turn on my favorite songand dust my shouldersDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI dont worry bout nothing just dust it offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI dont worry bout nothing just dust it offYou cant find your girlfriendYour boyfriend left youBut the partys still going onEverybody here sayingDust your shoulders offSee em kissing in the kitchenBy bathroomButcha dont let it phase youGo hit the bar upGo and key his car upTell him that its karmaCant keep me down me downIts only temporaryCant make me frown me frownSo I aint even worried Cause the world keep spinningLife goes on and onI wont cry for longCause it still be winningWhen things are going wrongI turn on my favorite songand dust my shouldersDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI dont worry bout nothing just dust it offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI dont worry bout nothing just dust it offI aint tripping over dramaAll about my numbersTell em get up outta my faceYou dont even know meYou dont even know meSave it for another dayI aint tripping over dramaAll about my numbersTell em get up outta my faceYou dont even know meYou dont even know meSave it for another dayNo big dealWin some you lose someBut life gets realWont last foreverCause the world keep spinningLife goes on and onI wont cry for longCause it still be winningWhen things are going wrongI turn on my favorite songand dust my shouldersDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI dont worry bout nothing just dust it offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offDust my shoulders offI dont worry bout nothing just dust it off
