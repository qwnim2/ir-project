Ill block the sun from your eyesIll make you feel so lovedAnd when the rain poursIll shelter youKeep you warmSafe in my armsSo dont hideFrom now till a million years awayWell still belong togetherOur love would find a way outFrom this hazy crazy worldSo come into The Sanctuary of Love Ive built for youCome on and seeCome on aroundCome on over and be with meCome into The Sanctuary of Love Ive built for youWont you come on and seeCome on aroundCome on overIll be there out on the streetsTo get you autumn leavesFresh dew from spring And the summers heatThe crystal clear icicles of winters timeSo you can put your tears awayAnd all of your regretsI assure youOur love is everything to gainAnd nothing else to loseSo come into The Sanctuary of Love Ive built for youCome on and seeCome on aroundCome on over and be with meCome into The Sanctuary of Love Ive built for youWont you come on and seeCome on aroundCome on overI know you havent made upHavent made up your mindBut sooner on laterI know I know youllCome come into The Sanctuary of Love for you
