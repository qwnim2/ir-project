作詞莫文蔚作曲伊秩弘將Hiromasa IjichiI dont need some guy to wine and dine me all the timeI dont need some other guy to tell me I look fineI wont hear a lie even if its all you have to sayNo more empty promises to keep me hanging on a lineJust as the music plays on and on each and every day Hey HeyThere is no other waySimply smile a little smile for you No matter what you doLove yourself every wayFeeling good thats your natural rightLove yourself every dayLooking good all thru day and nightYou oughtta know by now babyFeeling love is all you need to be a ladyAll I needs a lover wholl stand by me thru and thru And I need a love thats gonna stay forever trueI wont care at all even if you never say I love youIve got better things to do to make my dreams come trueAnd if the music dies life gose on each and every day Hey HeyThere is no other waySimply smile a little smile for you No matter what you doLove yourself every wayFeeling good thats your natural rightLove yourself every wayLooking good all thru day and nightLove yourself every wayWalking tall hold your head up highLove yourself every dayClose your eyes feel the love insideYou oughtta know by now babyLoving life is all you need to be a lady
