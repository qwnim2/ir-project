作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅We fell in love faster than lighteningBefore we got to knowEach others storyBut too much honesty then tore us by the seamsWe didnt know how to mend itSo decided to end itThen one day you called me to tell meYou kinda met a real cool ladyBut youre caught in betweenYou dont know how or whyBut you just know you still love meThat you cant forget meOh what a sad tragedyOh why oh whyHas love become so complicatedWas it real or was it just some twisted dreamAnd if we could justFast rewind and change one sceneThen take us back to the beginningThis time well make it for realTime after timeWe would talk it throughThe past was too much for you You took what you couldBut now youve lost the courage to start over newYoure not the man I once knewThings arent the way they used toSo what nowWhat can I do about itI love you I still do but where doWe go on from hereIt tears me up inside to hear you say you still love meBut you cant be with meWere stuck in this tragedyOh why oh whyHas love become so complicatedWas it real or was it just some twisted dreamAnd if we could justFast rewind and change one sceneThen take us back to the beginningThis time well make it for realHas love become so complicatedWas it real or was it just some twisted dreamAnd if we could justFast rewind and change one sceneThen take us back to the beginningThis time well make it for real
