LyricsKit ChanMusicKit ChanCase WooThe lonesome dreamerI adore her faceRaven black tressesFraming her pale faceThe lonesome dreamerWhy cant I be youI havent got the courageTo dream all aloneYou see it in her faceAll the painBut shes trying to smile To sing to laughTo live to loveTo lie to dieShe says She says She saysThe lonesome dreamerYou pretty angelYou dont need a manIn your Nevernever LandCan I get closerCan I touch your handsWill you still be there for me When our eyes meet
