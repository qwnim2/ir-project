作詞蔡健雅作曲蔡健雅Its been more than a yearBut feels more like foreverYou are still on my mindYoure still one of a kindThat no other men can replaceOh youre so much more than themTheyve all become just friendsThey just dont understandThe way you understandBut now youre gone cos Ive treated you wrongNow Im thinkingEvery other ways for me to get youGet you back into my lifeBut I dont know where you areI dont know where to startYou could be very farOr you could just live nearbySo for now ImLooking up my dictionary tryingTo find some unordinary words To say baby Im sorryCould you please forgive meOh babyWont you please come back into my lifeLifes never been the sameIve learnt it the hard wayThey say no pain no gainBut Ive gained nothing but painI know youre goneBut I still cant move onIts killing me to think that you might be inBe in some other girls armsI dont know if I canTake it like a manI dont think that I canWalk away or just pretendCant believeThat your girls not meThat your girls not meOh baby wont you please come back into my life
