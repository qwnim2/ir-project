All I needed was a little more timeTo find a way to to make it in lifeNot that I needed a round of applauseI only hoped that somehow youd appreciateOh Ive tried How Ive triedTried so hard to make you proudAll I needed was a shoulder to cry onAnd someone to to say its okNot that it was hard to try to be strongBut there were moments when I just had to BREAKDOWNOh Ive cried How Ive criedTears that you will never see Do you knowHow it hurts How it feels to be afraidOf the worldHow it feels to be aloneDo you know what it meansWhen you turn and walk awayDo you knowThat Ill ALWAYS let you downAll the years of silenceWalls between usAnd anger insideYoull misunderstand meIll pay you backIn a way that makes you mad
