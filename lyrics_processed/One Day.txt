作詞陳潔儀作曲Case Woo編曲Case WooOne day someday I will finallyKnow who I amWhat I wantAnd Why I liveOne day someday I will surpassAll these trappingsAll these schedulesAll my drive  motivationI will walk without my shoes onI will rise with the sunAnd wane with the moon I will owe no one an explainationI will be traceless leaving them without a clueOne day I will no longerBe a stranger to myselfI will swim with the swansAnd tease the dragonfliesThat land on my headI will walk without my shoes onI will rise with the sunAnd wane with the moonI will owe no one an explainationI will be traceless leaving them without a clue
