伸伸懶腰原曲Saturday of st DecemberIm left with me and a friendCounting tablesCounting crowsCounting the days I spend revolving the sunIf I could Drive Drive casuallyIll drive myself to sanityI wont be walking all nightLive life as it isIll live my life incessantlyIll be nowhere out of sight LiberationRelocationI must get out of this houseLooking forwardLooking for youLooking for someone to jump into my carIts hard enough to try to explainAnd if I did you wont understandIts hard enought to try to fit itThere must be a somewhat better plan
