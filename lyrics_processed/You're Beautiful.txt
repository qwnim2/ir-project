My life is brilliantMy life is brilliantMy love is pureI saw an angelOf that Im sureShe smiled at me on the subwayShe was with another manBut I wont lose no sleep on thatCause Ive got a planYoure beautiful Youre beautifulYoure beautiful its trueI saw your face in a crowded placeAnd I dont know what to doCause Ill never be with youYeah she caught my eyeAs we walked on by She could see from my face that I wasFucking highReal versionFlying highclean versionAnd I dont think that Ill see her againBut we shared a moment that will last till the endYoure beautiful Youre beautifulYoure beautiful its trueI saw your face in a crowded placeAnd I dont know what to doCause Ill never be with youYoure beautiful Youre beautifulYoure beautiful its trueThere must be an angel with a smile on her faceWhen she thought up that I should be with youBut its time to face the truthI will never be with you
