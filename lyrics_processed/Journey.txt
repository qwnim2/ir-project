作詞Corrinne May作曲Corrinne MayIts a long long journeyTill I know where Im supposed to beIts a long long journeyAnd I dont know if I can believeWhen shadows fall and block my eyesI am lost and know that I must hideIts a long long journeyTill I find my way home to youMany days Ive spentDrifting on through empty shoresWondering whats my purposeWondering how to make me strongI know I will falter I know I will cryI know youll be standing by my side Its a long long journeyAnd I need to be close to youSometimes it feels no one understandsI dont even know whyI do the things I doWhen pride builds me up till I cant see my soulWill you break down these walls and pull me throughCause Its a long long journeyTill I feel that I am worth the priceYou paid for me on calvaryBeneath those stormy skiesWhen Satan mocks and friends turn to foesIt feel like everything is out to make me lose controlCause Its a long long journeyTill I find my way home to you to you
