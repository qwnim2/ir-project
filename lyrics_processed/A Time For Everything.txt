作詞陳潔儀作曲宋 陽Now its time to draw the lineWe were never the same kindIm a fool to think that love would make wrongs rightI was blind now I see the lightThe end was written in the signsAll your promises were traps to hold me upTheres a time for everything under the skiesTheres a time to stay a time to keepA time to say goodbyeThe strength I found each time I looked into your eyesI was looking at myself the way you saw me deep insideIts ok its alrightEverything will turn out fineA time to break a time to healA time to give it upIm ok Im alrightLove has carried me this farIll learn to trust that God keeps perfect timeTheres a time for everything under the skies Theres a time to stay a time to keepA time to say goodbyeThe strength I found each time I looked into your eyesI was looking at myself the way you saw me deep insideIts ok its alrightEverything will turn out fineA time to break a time to healA time to give it upIm ok Im alrightLove has carried me this farIll learn to trust that God keeps perfect timeIts ok its alrightEverything will turn out fineA time to break a time to healA time to give it upIm ok Im alrightLove has carried me this farIll learn to trust that God keeps perfect timeIll learn to trust that He keeps perfect time
