Lyrics陳潔儀MusicBoxArrangerCase WooGary LeoRemember when a dream was all youve gotYet it made you happy you didnt need muchIts not true that life gets more complicatedIts the people that got more screwed upI know Ill miss you but I cant stand still　The worlds before me beyond that hill　The unknown is beckoning daring me to try　Its time to stretch these wings and fly＃This song is for my girl　Wherever you are　I hope you can be brave　And dont chicken out 　This song is for my girl　You know who you are　This aint goodbye　Im just checking outHey Ive been there  I know its roughYoure still so young but you feel burnt outBut baby living a lie is much more toughThrow caution to the wind  dont give upRepeat ＃The unknown is beckoning daring me to tryIts time to stretch these wings and flyRepeat ＃
