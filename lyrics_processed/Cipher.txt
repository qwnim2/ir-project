前身是影子OohHey there what is it todayThink Im gonna forget againThat I couldnt be the oneWish I had a name and a friendIm in pain cant you see it you feel itNow theres nobody there ooh I tell youIm in shame Im not worthy Im bleedingThe flower dont even careThis cipher from nowhere OohIm not the one to hold your handIt must have been a bad day againFor you who couldnt stand my faceYou wish I could be out of your sightI cant help it Im ugly I know itNow Im nobodys friend ooh I tell youIm in shame Im not worthy of beingMy father dont even care
