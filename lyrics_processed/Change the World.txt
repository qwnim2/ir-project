If I can reach the starsPull one down for youShine it on my heartSo you could see the truthThat this love I have insideIs everything it seemsBut for now I findIts only in my dreamsAnd I can change the worldI will be the sunlight in your universeYou would think my love was really something goodBaby if I could change the worldAnd if I could be queenEven for a dayId take you as my kingId have it no other wayAnd our love would rule This kingdom we had madeTill then Id be a foolWishing for the dayThat I can change the worldI would be the sunlight in your universeYou would think my love was really something goodBaby if I could change the worldBaby if I could change the worldI could change the worldI would be the sunlight in your universeYou would think my love was really something goodBaby if I could change the worldBaby if I could change the worldBaby if I could change the world
