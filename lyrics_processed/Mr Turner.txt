LyricsKit ChanMusicKit ChanIt was a fine Sunday morningWhen I walked into your roomAnd your eyes they were telling meYou didnt wanna be aloneOh how you made my heart acheI guess you didnt know thatFor Mr Turner Mr TurnerYor looked like my GrandpaYou room it was full ofThe sunshine of yesterdayThe pictures on your wallsThey made you smileOh but they made me cryI looked your bookshelvesYou were reading Gorbachev andThe Eastern Blocs historyThe Eastern Blocs historyAnd Edgar Allan PoeMr Tuner oh Mr TurnerOh How you made my heart acheI asked you why you came here You told me its just part of lifeYou said growing oldWas like being thrown in a poolAnd you had to swimOr you had to drownI told ya you didnt have to worryThat lifes just like a dayAnd growing up was sunriseAnd growing old was sunsetI wanna hold your hand in mineOh Mr Turner oh Mr TurnerYou know you were very much like my grandpaOh Mr Turner oh Mr TurnerAnd now that I have left youI wish you all the bestThat youll love your lifeLike youll love a good sunsetAnd then youll have all the glory ofThe dying rays of the sunThat will never setor the sun that will setBut will rise again someday
