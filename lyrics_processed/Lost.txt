LyricsTanyaMusicTanyaI never knew what I had lostTill you were thousand miles awayI laid out all the memoriesWandering why I let you go away in tearsWandering why I pushed you awayTell all the damage had been doneThen knew Id lost the best of meCos you loved me the mostCos youre all the things that Ive been yearning forCos you knew me the mostCos it hurts so bad when youre not aroundI close my eyes so I wont seeThe fact that youre not coming back Shattered dreams and broken heartsLeft in pieces for the night to pick them upOh then Ill get carried awayPutting them back togetherYet they never looked so incompleteCos you loved me the mostCos youre all the things that Ive been yearning forCos you knew me the mostCos it hurts so bad when youre not aroundWas love just passing byWere we only not meant to beWhen time gets to the truth so sunddenlyI just dont want to believe
