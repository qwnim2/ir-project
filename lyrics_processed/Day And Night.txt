Too much of a good thingCould just never be enoughAnd it brings you downIt makes you fear youll lose it somehowAnd thats how you make me feelAnd thats how you make me feelSo can I need you in my lifeCan I keep you close to meDay  Night Can I need you foreverI wanna have you close to me Day  NightI want something thats beautifulA love full of emotions  desireAnd something oh so innocentAnd yet so far beyond wordsThat you cant explain
