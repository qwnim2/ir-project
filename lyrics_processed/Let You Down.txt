Midnight is when loneliness creeps withinAnd Ive been wasting my timeGallivanting around towns all nightSick and tired of whats there in sightIts not that there is anything to denyIts just that pretending seems rightFunny how Ive kept my smile outsideBut this empty yearning deep insideTo everyone Im no more than prefectBut the fact that theres no harmonyAnd all these time I dreading the momentThat Ill finally let you downMidnight is when loneliness creeps withthinAnd Ive been wasting my time Gallivanting around towns all nightSick and tired of whats there in sightNot because Im feeling blueFact is I am afraid thatYoud see lies in my eyesAnd if one second given the choice to decideThen Id rather let me downTo everyone Im no more than prefectBut the fact is theres no harmonyAnd all these time Im dreading the momentThat Ill finally let you downThat Ill finally let you down
