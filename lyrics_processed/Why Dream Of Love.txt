LyricsStephen ClarkMusicDick LeeArranger馮文甫Is this what eyes where never meant to seeThe end of hope and all it meant to meHow can I find the strength to carry on another dayWithout my pride theres nothing left to sayIs this the way my life was meant to beToo late for me to say that I was wrongPerhaps the weak believe that they are strongI thought that if I tried Id find a way to earn their trustYet all Ive known and loved has turned to dustIt seems there was no way I could belongThe fire that burns within your heartThe pain that tears your life apartThe rain that falls from broken skiesThe love I lost beneath the lies And must I face the truth alongIs this the end of all Ive knownThe years I gaves the tears I criedWhy dream of love when love has diedI know one day the story will be toldAnd in the end the secrets will be soldAnd will they look at me and say I should have known the endPerhaps I did but why should I pretendI only dreamt of love and growing oldThe fire that burns within your heartThe pain that tears your life apartThe rain that falls from broken skiesThe love I lost beneath the liesAnd must I face the truth alongIs this the end of all Ive knownThe years I gaves the tears I criedWhy dream of love when love has died
