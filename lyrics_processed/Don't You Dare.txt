Far far away Ive travelledJust to get to the other sideThen you come along and haunt meDont you dare dont you dare get too closeLong long time ago you made itSeem like we were impossibleSo I wrote you off bad historyDont you dare dont you dare get too close Now that Im way ahead from where Ive left behindWho are you then to call me and ask if Im alrightNow that Im bright and beautiful youre fat and oldTo think Ive shed my pride for you down on my knees Tried hard to convince myself its not meWhos not good enough for youBring bring me a javelin quick Dont you dare dont you dare get too closerepeat Vanish now before I cryDiminish or else I mightHow how very unneccessaryTo see you walking down my hallI was hit by the shame in meDont you dare dont you dare get too close
