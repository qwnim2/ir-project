Hes got a smile that it seems to meReminds me of childhood memoriesWhere everything was as fresh as the bright blue skyNow and then when I see his faceHe takes me away to that special placeAnd if I stared too longId probably break down and crySweet child o mineSweet love of mineHes got eyes of the bluest skiesAs if they thought of rainI hate to look into those eyes And see an ounce of painHis hair reminds me of a warm safe placeWhere as a child Id hideAnd pray for the thunder and the rain to quietly pass me bySweet child o mineSweet love of mineWhere do we goWhere do we go nowWhere do we goSweet child o mine
