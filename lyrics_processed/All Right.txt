前身是好無聊Im frightened by the thought of hanging around too much on my ownThats when the demons come and play on my ground of thoughtsSomethings wrong with me yet I cant figure it out by myselfWhen will it be all rightTime passes by so slowly when you cannot sleep at nightWhen someone right comes along you let him slip awayThe streets are filled with sirens chasing down the violenceDamn  When will it be all rightNo it doesnt get betterWhen people fake it saying they understandWhat to them doesnt matterHow I ever got to feeling so lowI cant recall much happy moments in my childhood years When someone laughs at me Im nowhere to run and hideConstantly seeking ways to make a point but no one hearsWhen will I be all rightDont you start making compromisesIt wouldnt be of any use to me nowDont you start maling up for timeBecause it wouldnt be all rightIm frightened but the thought of hanging around too much on my ownThats when the demons come and play on my ground of thoughtsSomethings wrong with me yet I camt figure it out all by myselfWhen will it be all rightDamn When will it be all rightDamn When will it be all right
