I just wanna see you with somebody, that's all
I just wanna know you're with somebody, that's all
For all we've been through
All we have talked to
All we didn't do
Love never came through

I just wanna see you with somebody, that's all
I just wanna know you're with somebody, that's all
But here's to the good times
Here's to the late nights
Here's to the wild fights
We never came through

I run a mile in the park on the daily
I pop trains in the club don't be jelly
I'm doing fine on my own don't be worried
And finally, I can chill with no worries

See you know what I came to do, born to do, love to do
By all means I still got a lot of work to do
Yeah a lot of work to do

Talk about winning
Wining makes you keep on wanna winning
Fuck losing
Talk about winning
I guess I start to win when I lost you
I lost you

Guess I should deserve this now
Guess I should deserve this now
With you out of my life now
Guess I should deserve this now

It's been true true true
Been all about you you you

I just wanna see you with somebody, that's all
I just wanna know you're with somebody, that's all
But here's to the good times
Here's to the late nights
Here's to the wild fights
We never came through

I run a mile in the park on the daily
I pop trains in the club don't be jelly
I'm doing fine on my own don't be worried
And finally, I can chill with no worries
Do you know
I've been wondering lately now
(What I came to do, born to do, love to do)
I've been wondering lately now
(By all means I still got a lot of work to do)
Oh where you are
Oh where you are

Talk about winning
Winning makes you keep on wanna winning
Fuck losing
Talk about winning
I guess I start to win when I lost you
I lost you

Guess I should deserve this now
Guess I should deserve this now
With you out of my life now
Guess I should deserve this now

It's been true true true
Been all about you you you
