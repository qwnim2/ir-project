It's hard to sleep at night when you're lonely
It's hard to get the date when you're homely
if I could spit in my face　Hey please baby can I get your number?
Cause losers are look like so much funner
She told me, 'Can't we just be friends?'
She could have mentioned that before she let me in
I shave my head, I take a bath
My clothes are cool but they still laugh
I don't get luck, I feel so lame　Boy, do I got it made
Yea....
I bet you probably wished you never met me

But I'd gladly kiss your brown eyes if you let me
We might as well go and have some fun
Because I know that you're gonna dump me when you're done
I ask you once, I beg you twice　I don't get stone and I don't have lice
You said it ain't me, 'Please understand....'
That you like him and you don't like me
I ask you out, it never fails
You're too busy painting your nails
I feel so lame, I am so ashamed　Boy, do I got it made
Yea....　It's hard to sleep at night when you're lonely
It's hard to get a date, me so homely
