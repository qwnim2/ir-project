小提琴特別演奏 feat.王力宏
作詞：林俊傑/Mike Chang
作曲：林俊傑
編曲：林俊傑/王力宏

Just one shot
Is all you got to make or break into your fame
Just one shot
They will lift you up and take you down the same
Only got one shot
Will you give it all you've got
Let it take you to the top
Or will you bleed it out in vain?
Only got one shot
Tell your heart to never stop
Lock your eyes only on the spot
If there is no pain there will be no gain
O Father please, I ask for Your mercy
They judge me way before they even know me
O Father please, do you hear me screaming
These lights won't stop chasing after me
I will not fall I will not crawl, I will keep on standing tall
'Til I'm strong enough to break this wall
Oh~ I won't drown don't tie me down
Won't you just set me free
It takes one shot to strip it away from me
And O my Lord, I can't believe what I saw
You got one shot
Just to make or break your fame
Just one shot
They will lift you up, take you down the same
Only got one shot
Will you give it all you've got
Let it take you to the top

Or will you bleed it out in vain?
Only got one shot
Tell your heart to never stop
Lock your eyes only on the spot
If there is no pain there will be no gain
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
In thy name I pray to you, oh forever it remains
I know you haven't left me but I'm feeling so alone
When the darkness comes I shall never have to wait on my own
I feel so lost, my mind is going out of control
Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says The Lord
I'm persecuted but not forsaken, struck down to the floor
But not destroyed cause Its not like this hasn't happened before
I see these lights and you've warned me to be on the alert
My heart is tired from soaking it up like rain in the dirt
Oh~ just one shot
Oh~ yeah~
Yeah~ one shot
They will lift you up, take you down the same
Only got one shot
Will you give it all you've got
Let it take you to the top
Or will you bleed it out in vain?
Only got one shot
Tell your heart to never stop
Lock your eyes only on the spot
If there is no pain there will be no gain
