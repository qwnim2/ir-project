I have a blue balloon , a happy tune
Love enough to last me all through the afternoon
I have the New York time and 14 dimes and
Expectations of the most profound nursery rhyme
# Before the rivers run dry 　 Before the last say good-bye
Let's be kind to one another 　 we can try
So don't just throw your love above 　 It's not too late to find out
Before the sand has all run out of the hour glass
The carnival is here 　 The crown appears
Plastic painted people hold each other near

Hopes are always high 　 The echo of the sky and when it's over
There just a lonely sight of good-bye 　 ( Repeat # )
Too late to hide it now 　 It's all around us now
Oh ! How I want you girl 　 To lie beside me now
While there still this time 　 and now my balloon still rhyme
Let me love you now 　 We can drink a cool , good wine 　 ( Repeat # )
So don't just throw your love above 　 You and me had last find out
Before the sand has all run out of the hour-glass
