Spoken：
Hey, come here for a second
I don't like the way he treats you
He doesn't deserve you
He really don't

What kind of man
Would leave a woman standing in the cold
Must've been a silly one
To sacrifice a pot of gold
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man that's always there
It's not that you require a lot
Just ned some tender love and care
I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover
Soon as I get home from work
soon as I get home from work
Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie
For all it's worth
I give good love (good love,
good love, good love, good love)
It doesn't make sense
That you should have a broken heart

If I were the only one
I'd never let you fall apart
You're the kind of woman
That needs a man with lots of cash
With a stack of major credit cards
And with me you don't have to ask
I give good love
I'll buy your clothes
I'll cook your dinner too
Soon as I get home from work
I'll pay your rent
Your faithful lover
Soon as I get home from work,
soon as I get home from work

Girl, I'll treat you right
And I'll never lie or flirt
Soon as I get home, soon as I get home
Girl I'll be around, never let you down
For all it's worth
I give good love (good love,
good love, good love, good love)
I give good love (good love,
good love, good love, good love)

(Hook)
