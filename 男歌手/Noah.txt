Lyrics：王力宏
Music：王力宏

On the first of December I was commissioned to sall away
On a ship that was sinking Forty nights and forty days
And while I went under The tears of a murdered land
Were turning the earth info sand I'm too cold to be sleeping
So I light up a candle of regret To burn the secrets I'm keeping
And pray that someday I can forget The cries of my people
The voices of doubt inside my head I think of the things that you said
Am I alone here？Are there others like me too
Safe in my capsule Unable to move？How long has it been now？
And where will this journey end? Will it end...Ohhh.
Got the hands of a farmer The worlds of a preacher's tongur
Got the heart of a sailor To believe till your work is done
I will stand in the ocean with these wooden planks under my feet
I will come to your table After my journey's complete I believe in

the future
I can feel the blood rising in my veins It's the sound of a battle
cry
When only the echo remains I will serve you forever I will build you
a nation of love
I'm relying on luck,oh God The four-leaf clover from a dove
And isn't it crazy For me to start life brand new？
And when I find Ararat The first thing that I'll be singing a love
song
For my,mydear dear wife And nap in that sweet sunlight Before the night
is over
I'll be crying on your shoulder My wild imagination Is keeping me from
losing patience
Why did you make us Only to tear us away？Why have you chosen me？
It was your fault anyway...
