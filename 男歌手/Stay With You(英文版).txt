林俊傑 &amp; 孫燕姿

作詞：孫燕姿
作曲：林俊傑

Just the other day I heard your voices right by here
Maybe it's all in my head but still I feel you near
All the memories of your faces
Seem like days of yore
And if the walls are closing in We'll find a window deep within

I'll stay with you
Till the rays come through
Till we find a way and we'd say Look what time has held true

Stay with you
We will all come through
Till we find a way me and you We'd gather our dreams again
Come round I'll be here,
Right with you

Just the other day I heard your voices right by here
Maybe it's all in my head but still I feel you near
All the memories of your faces
Seem like days of yore

And if the walls are closing in We'll find a window deep within

I'll stay with you
Till the rays come through
Till we find a way and we'd say Look what time has held true

Stay with you
We will all come through
Till we find a way me and you We'd gather our dreams again
Come round I'll be here,
Right with you

I'll stay with you
Till the rays come through
Till we find a way and we'd say Look what time has held true

Stay with you
We will all come through
Till we find a way me and you
We'd gather all our dreams again
We may not all be the same
But come round I'll be here, right with you
