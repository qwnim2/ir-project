Yeah~China White
Listen
Yeah~Yeah

I got a feeling someone's gonna get hurt
Selling your soul for a bag full of purified dirt
It's gonna get you your diamond rings to sell to poor streets
And it's all over when the fat lady sings

You're stupid selling up the neighborhood
You've pick the wrong place, brother, for dealing your goods
You're going down fool, I promise you that
I'll hit you twice, before you can flinch, that's a fact

Coz you are a bum, coming into my town
I've got no places for you
I don't care how many guts you got
Coz I got Kung Fu and a badge
I'll be wooping your ass

Shanghai and LA in a colored big glass

China White China White, I'm gonna take you down
China White China White, And I'll be messing 'round
China White China White, Before my chance is gone
China White China White, Come on Come on

Coz you've been killing since the day you were born
Offering good times bounding so like a whore
How many in the single shape you diseased before you rest in peace

You took the mother from an innocent child
And knew the comers are the body of defiled
And now you're showing up my part of town
I wanna take you down Take you down

China White China White, Nobody's gonna stop me, man
China White China White, man, I'm seeing this shit
China White China White...
