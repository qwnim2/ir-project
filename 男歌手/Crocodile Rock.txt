I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzie had so much fun
Holding hands and skimming stones
Had an old gold chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the crocodile rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bobbing to the crocodile rock

Well crcodile rocking something shocking
Markes your feet just can't keep still
Never know me a better time
And I guess I never will
Oh lawdy mama friday night
When Suzie wore her dresses tight

Crocodile rocking was out of sight
La......La......
La......La......

When the years went by and rock just died
Suzie went and left a foreing guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my chevy and my old blue jeans
But they never killed the shrills we got
When they up to the crocodile rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the crocodile rock would last
