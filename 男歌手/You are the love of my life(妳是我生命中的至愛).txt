Lyrics：Kstegoll/D Hill

You are the love of my life
You are the reason I'm alive
And baby baby baby
When I think of how you saved me
I go cracy, oh......
And I've never known love like is
It fills me with a new tenderness
You're in my heart and you're in my soul
You're all I can't resist
And I need to tell you
The first time I held you
I knew, you are the love of my life
And I spend a life time waiting
Always hesistating until you

I was lost so deep inside my shell
Till you came and saved me from myself
Now all I really know is I need you
You are the love of my life
And all the joy and tears that I cry
And baby baby baby
You don't have to say the word
I see it in your eyes
'Cause we stand together
I promise forever till the day that I die
You are the love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the reason I'm alive
