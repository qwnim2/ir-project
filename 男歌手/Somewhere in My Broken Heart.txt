Lyrics：Billy Dean
Music：Roland Leigh

You made up your mind
It was time it was over
After we've had come so far
But I think there's enough
Pieces of forgiveness
Somewhere in my broken heart

I would not have chosen
The road you have taken
It has left us miles apart
But I think I can still find
The will to keep going
Somewhere in my broken heart

So fly Go ahead and fly
Till you find out who you are
And I, I will keep my love unspoken
Somewhere in my broken heart

I hope that in time you will find
What you long for love
That's written in the stars
When you finally leave
I think you will see it
Somewhere in my broken heart
(Somewhere in my broken heart)
