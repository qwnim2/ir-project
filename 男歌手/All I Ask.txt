I'm not asking you to change
Who you are, where you're going
I'm not asking you to lose.... control
I'm not asking for the world　Or you to keep it spinning
Just that you'll be the one receiving
All this lovin' that I'm giving

(Chorus)
All I ask is that you love me　In my own special way
Yet that I'm the one who holds you
Where there's nothing left to say
All I ask is that you need me　More than anybody else
That you're there for me to turn to
When I'm lost myself　All I ask of you, all I ask of you
Is that you love me　When I think of all the things
We will do when we're together　Say a little prayer for love
I won't take up all your time
Just give me all your precious moments　Baby open your arms
Let me fill them with emotion

(Chorus)
All I ask is that you love me　In my own special way
Yet that I'm the one who holds you　Where there's nothing left to say
All I ask is that you need me　More than anybody else
That you're there for me to turn to　When I'm lost myself
All I ask of you, all I ask of you　Is that you love me
That you love me　I believe, I believe, I believe
You were meant for me　Let you be, let you breathe, let you fly
'Cos you come right back to me
You come right back to me baby
(Chorus)
All I ask is that you love me　In my own special way
Yet that I'm the one who holds you　Where there's nothing left to say
All I ask is that you need me　More than anybody else
That you're there for me to turn to　When I'm lost myself
All I ask of you, all I ask of you　Is that you love me
That you love me　Tell me　Do you love me?
Do you love me?
