Emmanuel thinks about the girl He knows her all too well
She's got him a tangle And she's got him in her spell
She dances with his mind and she dances on the floor
And she knows how to drive him
So lo-co!(ad lib - passing chord: so she goes)

chorus by Emmanuel Emmanuel knows she's trouble
But what else can he do She's got him 'round his finger
With her different points of view
She can dance away her troubles
She's danced into his life
She got him working hard for her All night

Emmanuel seen it all But no like this before
A girl who turns up the heat By walking through the door
And when she hits the dancing floor She burns up all the lights
She's the one and only one thing in his sight
Emmanuel just doesn't know Where this all is gonna lead
He only knows what he wants And what he really needs
He needs to know What makes her tick and all her other games
He knows no other woman Be the same
