Lyrics：Trad
Music：Trad

The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

There is a ship and it sails on the sea
She is loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim

Oh love is handsome, love is kind
Love is a flower when first it's new
But love grows old and wax is cold
And fades away like morning dew

The water is wide and I can't cross over
Neither have I wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I
And both shall row my love and I
