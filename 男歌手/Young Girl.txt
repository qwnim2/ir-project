You've got the charm of a woman
You've kept the secret of your youth
You let me to believe
You're old enough to give me love
But now it hurts to know the truth

Wooh, wooh, young girl get out my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run girl, You're much too young girl
Beneath your perfume and make up
You're just a baby in disguise
Even though you know
That it's wrong to be alone with me

That come on look is in your eyes

Wooh, wooh, young girl get out of my mind
My love for yoou is way out of line
Better run girl, you're much too young girl

So hurry home to your mama
I'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out oof here before I have the time to
change my mind
Cause I'm afraid we'll too far
