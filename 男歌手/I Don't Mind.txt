I just wanna be here
On my chair with my legs up high
Taking in the sun
On my skin does it feel alright
Stay if you want to
Leave if you want to
I don't mind, oh I don't mind

Loving imperfection
Is the way to love somebody
Getting in position
When your mind and your heart is ready
Stay if you want to
Leave if you want to
I don't mind, oh I don't mind

People wanna
People wanna know all about it
What I'm doing
I'm just living life in the moment
People wanna
People wanna hear all about it
What I'm doing
I'm fine

Yeah
喜歡在太陽下
喜歡活在當下
Yeah
現在的我從此自由自在地
生活
自在地奮鬥
自在地為自己活

Yeah
我世界很廣闊
就算一個人過
Yeah

也可以一個人獨自霸佔這天空
躺在這雲朵
享受夜晚的煙火

I just wanna be here

Stay if you want to
Leave if you want to
I don't mind, oh I don't mind

Loving imperfection
Is the way to love somebody
Getting in position
When your mind and your heart is ready
Stay if you want to

People wanna

What I'm doing
I'm fine

Yeah
下雨天  紅綠燈  斑馬線  暫停了時間
其實每個人  忙碌的  都有著  一個夢  想把它實現
如果真的有一天  對的時候  對的人出現
霸佔的天空  這雲朵和煙火  你都會在我身邊

People wanna
People wanna know all about it
What I'm doing
I'm just living life in the moment
