Lyrics：John Lennon/Paul Mccartney

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
And our friends are all on board
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in our yellow submarine,

Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
as we live a life of ease
Everyone of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
We all live in our yellow submarine,
Yellow submarine, Yellow submarine
