I want you back
Wonder if it's too late
As I
Go through the reasons why I asked for a break

And I sit where you sat
On the bed at my place
Thinking
Yeah the fight was bad but I wish you stayed

Marks on the floor
Broke a plate and went out the door
Gone away now it's nearly four
I can't sleep until you come home

I run
And there you are
You hear me calling
The sun
Is almost up
You say you're sorry

Love is full of rollercoasters baby
(So don't let go, oh don't)
Oh sometimes there's a low before the high
(I won't let go, I won't)
Love is full of rollercoasters baby
(So don't let go, oh don't)
Oh we just gotta hold on every time

I start a fire
In the back of your mind
Needless
I forget that you're the light in my life

And you scream that your done
I should go back to mine
Speechless
I put on my coat trying not cry

Marks on the floor
Kicked a vase and went out the door
Gone away now it's nearly four
You can't sleep until I come home

You run
Under the stars
I hear you calling

The sun
Is almost up
I say I'm sorry

Love is full of rollercoasters baby
(So don't let go, oh don't)
Oh sometimes there's a low before the high
(I won't let go, I won't)
Love is full of rollercoasters baby
(So don't let go, oh don't)
Oh we just gotta hold on every time
