Well I dreamed about today 　 The same dream in many ways
But I never thought I'd be here 　 Be here with you my pretty one
Well I've searched the whole world through
To find someone who would make this
Dream come true it's you 　 And only you my pretty one
Pretty one I long to hold you
Through the night I want to hold you
Through the night I want to hold you
Pretty one has no one told you I love you
Anyday and you will find me full of joy 　 When you're beside me
In a moment like htis could it be what 　 I've missed all my life ?
* Well I dreamed about today 　 The same dream in so many ways
But nothing can compare with 　 Compare with you my pretty one

Well I love your smile and I love you eyes
And the way you talk makes me feel so nice
Nothing can compare wiht the way you are
And I need you now , and I like you so
Did I hear you say you're the only one
And with only breath I'm in the air 　 Repeat *
But I never thought I'd be 　 Be here with you my pretty one
Pretty one I lond to hold you 　 Through the night I want to hold you
Pretty one has no one told you I love you
Anyday you will find me 　 Full of joy when you're beside me
In a moment like this could it be 　 What I've missed all my life
