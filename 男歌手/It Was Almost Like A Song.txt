Lyrics：Archie Jordan/David Hal
Music：Archie Jordan/David Hal

Once in every life
Someone comes along
And you came to me
It was almost like a song
You were in my arms
Right where you belong
And we were so in love
It was almost like a song

January through December
We had such a perfect year
Then the flame became a dying ember
All at once you weren't here

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each
Night and it's almost like a song
But it's much too sad
To write we were so in love
It was almost like a song

Now my broken heart
Cries for you each
Night and It's almost like a song
But it's much too sad to write
Much too sad to write
It was almost like a song
