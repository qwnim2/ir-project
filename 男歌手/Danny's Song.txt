People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one
And we've just begun, I think I'm gonna have a son
He will be like she and me, free as a dove
Conceived in love, the sun is gonna shine above

Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
In the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me
Everything's gonna be all right
Love a girl who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up, love her and she'll bring you luck
If you find she helps your mind, better take her home
Oh dontcha live alone, try to earn what lovers own

Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
In the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me
Everything's gonna be all right

Even though we ain't got money
I'm so in love with you honey
Everything will bring a chain of love
In the morning when I rise
Bring a tear of joy to my eyes and tell me
Everything's gonna be all right
