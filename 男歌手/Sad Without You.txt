I'm sitting here alone wondering what to do
Thinking about you , feeling sad and blue
We were so in love , not so long ago
We had everything , now we've lost it all
* 傷心 , 沒有你傷心　　 ( sad without you )
　傷心 , 沒有你傷心 . . . .
Now there' s omeone new 　 He's everything to you
There's nothing I can do 　 I hope that he'll be true
What more can I say 　 I'll wait for you each day
Maybe then someday 　 You'll see me and you'll say 　 Repeat *
