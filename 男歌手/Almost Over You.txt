I saw an old friend of ours today 　 He asked about you
I didn't quite know what to say
Heard you been makin' the rounds round here
While I've been tryin' to make tears disappear
* Now I'm almost over you 　 I've almost shook these blues
So when you come back around 　 After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
You're such a sly one with your cold , cold heart
Maybe leavin' came easy 　 But it tore me apart

Time heals all wounds , they say
And I should know 'cause it seems
Like forever but I lettin' you go 　 ( Repeat * )
I can't forgive you and soon I'll
Forget all the shattered dreams
All though you left me with nothing to show
Full of misery 　 ( Repeat * )
When you come back around 　 After painting the town
You'll see I'm almost over you
