Lyrics：John Laudon
Music：John Laudon
Featuring：黎晶

Just a gentle whisper, told me that you'd gone
Leaving only memories, where did we go wrong?
I couldn't find the words then, so let me say them now
I'm still in love with you

Tell me that you love me, tell me that you care
Tell me that you need me, and I'll be there
I'll be there waiting

I will always love you, I will always stay true
There's no one who loves you like I do
Come to me now
I will never leave you, I will stay here with you
Through the good and bad I will stand true
I'm in love with you

Now we're here together, yesterday has past
Life is just beginning, close to you at last
And I promise to you, I will always be there

I give my all to you

Living life without you is more than I can bear
Hold me close forever,
I'll be there....
I'll be there for you

I will always love you, I will always stay true
There's no one who loves you like I do
This I promise...
I will never leave you, I will stay here with you
Through the good and bad I will stand true
Hold me closer...
Our love is forever, holding us together
Nothing in this world can stop us now
Love has found, love has found a way

I'm in love　(I so in love)
I'm in love　Yes　(I'm in love)
I so in love with you
