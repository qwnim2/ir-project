作詞：David Gates
作曲：David Gates

All your life you've waited for love to come and stay
And now that I have found youyou must not slip away
I know it's hard believin' the words you've heard before
but darlin' you must trust them just once more

'Cause m' baby goodbye doesn't mean forever
let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean We'll never be together again
If you wake up and I'm not thereI won't be long away
'cause the things you do my goodbye girl will bring me back to you

I know you've been taken afraid to hurt again
You fight the love you feel for me instead of givin' in
But i can wait foreverwhile helpin' you to see that I was meant for you and you for me

So remember goodbye doesn't mean forever
Let me tell you goodbye doesn't mean we'll never be together again
Though we may be so far apart you still would have my heart
So forget your past my goodbye girl
'cause now you're home at last
