Lyrics：Dan Hill
Music：Barry Mann
Artist：李度

【周】You ask me if I love you. And I choke on my reply.
【周】I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie.
【李】And who am I to judge you on what you say or do?
【李】I'm only just beginning to see the real you.
【周】And sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much.
【周】And I have to close my eyes and hide.
【李】I wanna hold you till I die.
【李】Till we both break down and cry.
【李】I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.
【李】Romance and all its strategy leaves
【李】me battling with my pride.
【【李But through the insecurity some tenderness survives.
【周】I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truths.
【周】A hesitate prize fighter still trapped within my youth.
【周】And sometimes when we touch, the honesty's too much.

【周】And I have to close my eyes and hide.
【合】I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry.
【合】I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.
【周】At times I'd like to break you (【李】at times I'd like to break you)
【周】and drive you to your knees (【李】and drive you to your knees)
【李】At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly.
【周】At times I understand you and I know how hard you've tried.
【周】I've watched while love commands you and I've watched love pass you by.
【李】At times I think we're drifters,
【李】still searching for a friend (【周】 still searching for a friend),
【李】a brother or a sister. But then the passion flares again.
【周】 And sometimes when we touch(【李】sometimes when we touch) ,
【周】the honesty's too much (【李】honesty).
【周】And I have to close my eyes and hide.
【合】I wanna hold you till I die. Till we both break down and cry.
【合】I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides.
