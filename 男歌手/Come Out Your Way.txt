And there's a bird in the sky looking right at us
Seeing the footsteps we each take
As we're closer to meet at once

And there's a bird on the tree
Singing right at us
As you walk in
The coffee shop
That's the day we first met

Chorus
So I say come out your way
Come out your way with me
There's no regret, there's no return
All I need is you

So baby come out your way
Come out your way with me
I love you so, I love you so
You just have to walk through that door


And there's a bird in the nest crying just like us
Our love has been through some ups and downs
Sometimes we just need a breath

And there's a bird in the air laughing just like us

Chorus
So I say come out your way
Come out your way with me
There's no regret, there's no return
All I need is you

So baby come out your way
Come out your way with me
I love you so, I love you so
You just have to walk through that door

With you I know, you are my one
I'll hold you in my heart

So I say come out your way
Come out your way with me
There's no regret, there's no return
All I need is you

So baby come out your way
Come out your way with me
I love you so, I love you so
You just have to walk through that door
