Woo I need your love babe　Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe　Just like I need you
Hold me love me　Hold me love me
I ain't got noghin but love babe　Eight days a week
Love you everyday girl　Always on my mind　One thing
I can say girl　Love you all the time
Eight days a week　I love you　Eight days a week
Is not enough to show I care
Woo I need your love babe　Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe　Just like I need you
Love you everyday girl　Always on my mind　One thing
I can say girl　Love you all the time
