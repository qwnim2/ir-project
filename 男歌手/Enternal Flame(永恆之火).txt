Lyricsï¼šS.Hoffs/B.Steinberg/T.Kelly

Close your eyes, give me your hand, darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Is this buring an eternal flame
I believe it's meant to be, daring
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same
Am I only dreaming
Or is this buring an eternal flame
Say my name sun shines through the rain
A whole life so lonely
And then you come and ease the pain
I don't want to lose this feeling
