There's something about you
That's a little wild
There's nobody that compares to you
There's something about you
I can't get enough
I'd like to wake up next to you

And I fell for a little while
But you've always been there you've stayed
I love you in so many ways
And everyday
We played and we fooled around
For hard times to go
Yeah we stick through it all
My babe

There's not a day to be wasted
When you are here with me
We fight love then we make up
As long as you always believe in me

And if you do just tell me you do
Cuz I can't live a day without you

There's something about you
I can't get enough
I'd like to wake up next to you

And I fell for a little while
But you've always been there you've stayed
I love you in so many ways
And everyday
We played and we fooled around
For hard times to go
Yeah we stick through it all
My babe

There's not a day to be wasted
When you are here with me
We fight love then we make up
As long as you always believe in me

And if you do just tell me you do
Cuz I can't live a day without you
There's something about you I am addicted
There are some days we will be blue
But I will always love you
