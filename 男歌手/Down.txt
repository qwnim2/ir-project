I can't believe it. Tell me I'm dreaming.
That we are still 'we'.
It was amazing Said you were lucky
That you found me

It was on a rainy day that we met
You didn't have a place to go
I said we just met so lets go slow but no
You just told me to keep you from the cold
Sorry I can take it
Why did u fake it Why did we kiss
And I'm just down
You left me with a note without a sound
I figured I must have been such a child

You'll never know how much I've been around
How my heart just frowns

If you're down
I'll be your teddy bear,I'll be your clown
I'll take you round and round and
If you don't mind I could be your standing ground

Even if that means I'd drown
And baby, that'll be my one last vow
