Lyrics：Graeme Clark/Tommy Cunningham
Music：Neil Mitchell

You hear me so clearly
And see how I try
You feel me so heal me
And tear me apart
And I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
And do they have to know
About my good night girl

Cut up in your wishin' well
Your hopes and sadness
Take your love in promises
You make them last, you make them last

You keep me so near you
And see me so far
And hold me and send me
And deep in your heart
And I won't tell a soul
I won't tell at all
And I won't let them know
About my good night girl

Doesn't matter how sad I made you
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Just remember the same old reason
in your eyes
said you want me
