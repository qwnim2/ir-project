Corazon De Melao,Melao Melao

Emmanuel thinks about the girl
He knows all too well
She's got him tangle
And she's got him in her spell
She dances with his mind
And she dances on the floor
And she knows how to drive him So lo-co!
(ad lib-passing chord: so she goes) chorus by Emmanuel

Emmanuel knows she's trouble
But what else can he do
She's got him'round his finger with her different points of view
She can dance away her troubles she's danced into his life
She got him working hard for him all night!

Emmanuel seen it all But no like this before
A girl who turns up the heat By walking through the door
and when she hits the dance floor
She burns up all the lights
She's the one and only one thing in his sight

Emmanurl just doesn't know Where this all is gonna lead
He only know what he wants And what he really needs
He needs to know what makes her tick And all her other games
He knows no other woman be the same
