電視劇 小女花不棄 插曲

作詞：薛之謙
作曲：薛之謙

我等的模樣好不具象
用皮膚感受你的流向
你竟然能做到帶走陽光
我一味的跟隨過了量

像風一樣
你靠近雲都下降
你卷起千層海浪
我躲也不躲往里闖

你不就像風一樣
侵略時沙沙作響
再宣佈恢復晴朗
就好像我們兩個沒愛過一樣

曲折的夕陽負責格擋
讓委屈的感官無法釋放
最近我的傷口沒生長
因為我躲在沒風的地方

像風一樣
你靠近雲都下降
你卷起千層海浪
我躲也不躲往里闖

你不就像風一樣
侵略時沙沙作響
再宣佈恢復晴朗
就好像我們兩個沒愛過一樣

你像風一樣
觸摸時溫柔流淌
席捲我所有抵抗不急著要我投降

你不就像風一樣
掠奪時沙沙作響
可惜我自投羅網
你也就沒什麼可驕傲的地方

和風一樣
你離開不聲不響
我喜歡這種收場
看上去誰也不曾虧欠過對方

像風一樣 Like the wind

《小女花不棄 I Will Never Let You Go 》電視劇插曲

我等的模樣好不具象
The appearance I waited for, was so nondescript
用皮膚感受你的流向
With my skin, I felt about for the direction in which you flew
你竟然能做到帶走陽光
You could actually take away the sunshine
我一味的跟隨過了量
I blindly followed you till I went overboard

像風一樣
Like the wind
你靠近雲都下降
When you approached, even clouds descended
你捲起千層海浪我躲也不躲往裡闖
You swirled up a thousand layers of sea waves
I didn't dodge but dashed directly towards them

你不就像風一樣
Don't you resemble the wind?
侵略時沙沙作響
When you invaded, you rustled
再宣佈恢復晴朗
Then you declared that [the sky]had cleared up
就好像我們兩個沒愛過一樣
as if we had never been in love

曲折的夕陽負責格擋
The tortuous setting sun was in charge of warding off [the thought of you]
讓委屈的感官無法釋放
So my sensory organs were unable to release the grievance
最近我的傷口沒生長
Recently my wounds haven't been growing
因為我躲在沒風的地方
Because I've been hiding in a windless place

像風一樣
Like the wind
你靠近雲都下降
When you approached, even clouds descended
你捲起千層海浪我躲也不躲往裡闖
You swirled up a thousand layers of sea waves
I didn't dodge but dashed directly towards them

你不就像風一樣
Don't you resemble the wind?
侵略時沙沙作響
When you invaded, you rustled
再宣佈恢復晴朗
Then you declared that [the sky]had cleared up
就好像我們兩個沒愛過一樣
as if we had never been in love

你像風一樣
You are just like the wind
觸摸時溫柔流淌
When I felt about for you, you flew with all the gentleness
席捲我所有抵抗不急著要我投降
You engulfed all my resistance. You didn't rush me to give in

你不就像風一樣
Aren't you just like the wind
掠奪時沙沙作響
When you plundered, you rustled
可惜我自投羅網
Too bad that I cast myself into the net [bit the hook]
你也就沒什麼可驕傲的地方
So there's nothing you can be proud of [You can't take credit for sweeping me off my feet]

和風一樣
Like the wind
你離開不聲不響
You left without making a sound
我喜歡這種收場
I like this denouement
看上去誰也不曾虧欠過對方
It looks as if we never owed each other anything
