作曲：Radiohead (Homas Edward Yorke、Jonathan Richard Guy Greenwood、Philip James Selway、Colin Charles Greenwood、Edward John O'Brien)

A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

You look so tired and unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us

I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises

Silent, silent

This is my final fit, my final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please

Such a pretty house, and such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please
