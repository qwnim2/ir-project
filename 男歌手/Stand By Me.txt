When the night has come
And the land is dark
and the moon is the only light we'll see
No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
And darling, darling
Stand by me
Oh stand by me, oh stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shed a tear
No I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
And darling, darling

Stand by me
Oh stand by me, oh stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

I won't cry, I won't cry
No I won't shead a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me
And darling, darling
Stand by me
Oh stand by me, oh stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

Whenever you're in trouble
Won't you stand by me
Oh stand by me
Oh won't you stand now
Stand by me, stand by me
