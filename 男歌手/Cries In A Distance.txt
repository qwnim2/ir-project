▲Cries in a distance
Can't stop the tremble
I'm just awaiting my turn

Hiding will never
Save me forever
The guns gonna get me for sure

Dear God I pray why won't you be my friend
Come to me and take my hand

Like mama would say
Everything will be okay

The all I hear is 3 2 1
The scream from the guns

My tears start to bleed
Smell of roses on my feet

I feel sore...
I fall...
I call...
I crawl...▲
