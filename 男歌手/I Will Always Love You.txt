Lyrics：Dolly Parton
Music：Dolly Parton

My love I know that I'll always love you
I said these words the very first time when I met you
We've been together now for many long years
And I still keep saying these same words to you

I love you, I love you
Cause you were always there when I needed you most
I love you, I love you
You gave me strength you gave me hope
And you gave me all your love

Darling I know there'll never be another you
In my life you're only one for me, that I know
I'll never stop saying these words to you
I like to thank you for your love and this is for you

I love you, I love you
Cause you were always there when I needed you most
I love you, I love you
You gave me strength you gave me hope
And you gave me all your love
