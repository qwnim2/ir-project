Arranger：Phil Rigger

Let's dance in style　Let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait　We're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best　But expecting the worst
Are you going to drop the bomb or not
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power　But we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit　Life is a short trip
The music's for the sad men
Can you imagine when this race is won
Turn our own faces into the sun
Praising our leaders　We're getting in tune
The music's played by the madmen
Forever young, I want to be forever young

Do you really want to live forever
Forever and ever (forever young)
Some are like water　Some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
Sonner or later, they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young
It's so hard to get on to a better course
I don't wat to perish like a fleeing horse
Youth's like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever
So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams swinging out of the blue　Come true
