Late at night when the wind is still, I'll come flying through your door.
And you'll know what love is for.
　　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　Yeh yeh yeh...
　　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　Yeh yeh yeh...
Touch your lips with a magic kiss and you'll be a blue bird too.
And you'll know what love can do.
　　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　Yeh yeh yeh...
　　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　I'm a bluebird.　Yeh yeh yeh...
　　Blue bird bluebird

Al-ha. bluebird bluebird Al-ha. Blue bird bluebird Al-ha.

Fly away through the midnight air as we head cross the sea.
And at last we will be free.
You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird.　Yeh yeh yeh...
You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird.　Yeh yeh yeh...
　　Blue bird　bluebird Al-ha.　Blue bird　bluebird　Al-ha.　Blue bird bluebird Al-ha.
　　Blue birdbluebird Al-ha.　Blue bird　bluebird Al-ha.　Blue bird bluebird Al-ha.
All alone on a desert island.　We're living in the trees and we're flying in the breeze.
You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird.　You're a bluebird. Yeh yeh yeh...
