In the first time of my life
I have never felt the way I did
There's something about you and I
That pulls us into something true

Sunday hikes and morning bikes
Little things that makes me feel just right
I thought I knew what love was like
But then you show me what was right

Cus as I look back
To all the good times
Baby baby in my eyes
Oh you are paradise

Cus as I look back
Oh you are everything I love
And I will be right here for you
And there will be no one
No one else like you

In the first time of my life
I have never felt the way I did
