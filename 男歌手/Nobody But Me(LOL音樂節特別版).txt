向前進
每一場戰役都要勝利
不要放棄
就算對手再強都要贏

爭不爭氣
無論輸贏
都想繼續努力
每ㄧ個你
都想前進
渴望登峰造極

cuz there ainʼt nobody, body
thatʼll look at you with pride
completely satisfied
If you donʼt give a fight
nobody, baby
Till youʼre fighting to the last
And giving out the best
no
ainʼt nobody, body
thatʼll look at you with pride
completely satisfied
If you donʼt give a fight
nobody, baby
Till youʼre fighting to the last
And giving out the best
no
來登峰造極

峽谷叢林
危機四伏刀光的劍影
屏住呼吸
勝負成敗就在此一舉
對手脾氣
技能CD
全都了然於心
在戰鬥裡
幾秒差異

cuz there ainʼt nobody, body

If you donʼt give a fight

Till youʼre fighting to the last
And giving out the best

If you donʼt give a fight

Till youʼre fighting to the last
And giving out the best

Weʼre undone
Weʼre undone

cuz there ainʼt nobody, body
thatʼll look at you with pride
completely satisfied
If you donʼt give a fight
nobody, baby
Till youʼre fighting to the last
And giving out the best

If you donʼt give a fight

Till youʼre fighting to the last
