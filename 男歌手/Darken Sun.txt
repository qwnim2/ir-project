* 1 A darkened sun 　 A cloudy sky 　 An empty heart
It's over now , with some regrets 　 Living for our past memories
Your changing smile 　 And shining eyes , made me a king
And crownless now , standing alone
Hearing you cry for your liberty
A darkened sun 　 A crownless king
* 2 A fading hope 　 Mistaken way
A foolish man 　 But now I hear , I truly hear
The sun might shine 　 The sky could glow , our hearts would sing
If our love could be 　 Pure lovely and free
The sky will glow , our hearts will sing 　 ( Repeat * 1 )
Now you hear , as I'd hoped you would
When I tore up the white page
The letter full of empty words you gave me
I knew one day you'd know 　 You'd really know
That I don't need a king and crazy promises 　 ( Repeat * 2 )
