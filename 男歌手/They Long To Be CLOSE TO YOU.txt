作曲：BACHARACH BURT F、DAVID HAL

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the boys in town
Follow you all around
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue

That is why all the guys in town
Follow you all around
Just like me they long to be
Close to you

Close to you
I wanna be close to you
I wanna be close to you

So close, so close, baby
I wanna be close to you
So close, so close, girl
I wanna be close to you
