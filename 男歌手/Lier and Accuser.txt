Oh come fill these dried waters
That is my heart's one desire
The One who does not falter
You are my heart's one desire
I'd be with You just a little longer

They don't even know me
With their tongues they crucify me
Won't You vindicate me
Fend me from those false accusations

So the lier and accuser
Shall be judged by the Father's Fire
So as they feed on my honour
They will also feed His anger
Those words are fuelling the Flame

They don't even know me
With their words they terrorise me
Won't You vindicate me
Fend me from those false accusations

Save me from this wretched perversion

Destroying those disguises
Ushering the misguided
May Your Light shine through
May Your Light shine
Shine shine shine

Destroying those disguises
Ushering the misguided
May Your light shine through
May Your light shine
Shine shine shine

Oh come fill these dried waters
That is my heart's one desire
The One who does not falter
You are my heart's one desire
To be with You just a little longer
