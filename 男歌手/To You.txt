Once I never thought love
I found you like I did love
I came out of the rain and fell into your eyes
And I realize my love is coming close to me
So I want to give All my love to you

＊Now I wonder how your Fell about the way I love you
Do you miss me as I miss you in my dreams
Waking up and see your smilling face in front of me

Want to send my love all My life to you

＃Tell me where do we go from here
Oh my love I want you always near me everyday
Love is here to stay
Now that all of my dreams came true
There is one more thing I need to say is
How I love you Oh I really love you from me to you

Repeat ＊,＃　＃
