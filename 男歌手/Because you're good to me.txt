Because you're good to me babe, I know
That you're up to something　And I don't like it

Because you're good to me babe, I know
You're no good　It's no good　To be in love with you again

當時分手之後　多麼心痛
你卻還能夠說　都是我的錯
之後你打電話　說你很寂寞
一直想念我　是否還能夠做個朋友

(No baby　No baby)　請你別再靠近我
(No baby　No baby)　你沒那麼的保守
(No baby　No baby)　別到現在才來對我說
你後悔了　And ask me for more

Because you're good to me babe, I know
That you're up to something　And I don't like it

Because you're good to me babe, I know
You're no good　It's no good
To be in love with you again

昨晚跟好朋友　開個 Party
怎麼都沒想到　會再見到你
你的甜言蜜語　讓我佩服到底
誰在誰懷裏　愛誰不過是個騙局
