Music：王力宏
Arranger：王力宏/Robert Lay

I'm about to go off like a gunshot
I wanna make you drip like a sweatshop
I'm about to make sounds that you never heard
I'm gonna take your locks and break them with
the keys in your hand and a microphone in mine

Man, it makes me high (It makes me high)
Lifts me to the sky (Yeah, yeah...)
Love is just a lie (It's just a lie)

What made me so high? (What made me so...)

I have got, to admit, this homeboy, he won't quit
Makin' beats, talkin' shit, spittin' fast, keepin' fit
Session file, 24 bit, on the stage, is where I'm lit
All my fans, freakin' it, jumpin' round, 'cause they don't sit
(They don't sit you all)

I'm talkin' bout body surfin', hands wavin' booties jerkin'
Some may dabble in the fountain of funk but as for us
We're already swimming in it!!!!!
