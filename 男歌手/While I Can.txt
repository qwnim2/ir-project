I've, been waking up inside a wonderland I don't know
High, above the clouds now we're the ones who cast the shadows

Don't let me fall asleep
Don't let me disbelieve
You gotta be the one to keep me focused
Tear my heart open
I've never felt this way
Swear you could change my name
You're gonna be the reason I'm unbroken

I'm gonna hold you while I can
Cos you got me feeling things I don't understand
I'll give up my pride and all my plans
Every second here with you is like falling sand

The more I hold you the more I lose you the more I know
Nothing lasts, we're frames of glass that break like bones
It don't matter, if all this shatters, all this goes
I'll take that chance
I'm gonna hold you while I can

I can't take this
I keep slipping back
These old habits can't die too fast

Don't let me fall asleep
Don't let me disbelieve
You gotta be the one to keep me focused
Tear my heart open
I've never felt this way
Swear you could change my name
You're gonna be the reason I'm unbroken

I'm gonna hold you while I can
Cos you got me feeling things I don't understand
I'll give up my pride and all my plans
Every second here with you is like falling sand

The more I hold you the more I lose you the more I know
Nothing lasts, we're frames of glass that break like bones
It don't matter, if all this shatters, all this goes
I'll take that chance
I'm gonna hold you while I can
I'm gonna hold you while I can

I'm gonna hold you while I can
Cos you got me feeling things I don't understand
I'll give up my pride and all my plans
Every second here with you is like falling sand

I'm gonna hold you while I can
I'm gonna hold you while I can
I'm gonna hold you while I can

I've been waking up inside a wonderland I don't know
醒在陌生的奇境
High above the clouds now we're the ones who cast the shadows
在雲端之上營造腳下的倒影

Don't let me fall asleep
別讓我入睡
Don't let me disbelieve
別讓我拒絕相信
You gotta be the one to keep me focused
你是我專注的源泉
Tear my heart open
敞開我的內心世界
I've never felt this way
這種感覺前所未有
Swear you could change my name
我甚至願意為你改變姓名
You're gonna be the reason I'm unbroken

所能之際 緊抱你
Cos you got me feeling things I don't understand
你讓我感受到了自己也參不透的情緒
I'll give up my pride and all my plans
我願為你放棄一切尊嚴與規劃
Every second here with you is like falling sand
和你相處的每一秒飛逝如流沙

The more I hold you the more I lose you the more I know
越是擁有 越是失去 我越來越明白
Nothing lasts we're frames of glass that break like bones
我們易碎如玻璃 一切終究成空
It don't matter if all this shatters all this goes
雖然如此我依然願意粉身碎骨
I'll take that chance
我願冒險
I'm gonna hold you while I can
所能之際 緊抱你

I can't take this
我無法承受
I keep slipping back
不斷重蹈覆轍
These old habits can't die too fast
難以擺脫舊患
