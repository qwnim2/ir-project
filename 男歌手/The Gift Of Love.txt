Arranger：Wayne Miller

You asked me what I want you asked me what I need
It's nothing you can buy my heart's not ruled by greed
I don't give diamond diamonds you see through
I want you to hold me I want you to be true
Give me the gift of love　Look me in the eys
Say I'm the oneyou're dreaming of
That would be the best surprise
Give me the gift of your sweet love
In the light of the day　In the dark of night
Like the colours of the sun the feelings in your heart
It's all I want from you and whne the sky is dark
I'll have you beside me, who could ask for more
I'll just wear a smile when you walk in the door
