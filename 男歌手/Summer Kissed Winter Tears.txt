Summer kisses winter tears 　 That was what she gave to me
Never thought I'd travel all alone 　 The trip of memories
Happy hours lonely years 　 But I guess I can't complain
For I still recall the summer sun 　 Through all the winter rain
The fire of love 　 Can't burn from afar 　 And nothing can light
The dark of the night 　 Like a falling star
Summer kisses winter tears 　 Like the stars they fade away
Leaving me to spend my lonely nights 　 With dreams of yesterday
