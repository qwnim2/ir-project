Well it's one for the money　Two for the show
Three get ready now go cat go
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
(Well) You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
You can knock me down　Step on my face
Slander my name all over the place
Do anything that you wanna do
But ah ah honey lay off my shoes
Don't you step on blue suede shoes

(Well) You can burn my house　Steal my car
Drink my liques from the old fruit jar
Do anything that you want to do
But ah ah honey lay off of my shoes
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Well you can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
Blue blue blue suede shoes　Blue blue blue suede shoes
Blue blue blue suede shoes　Blue blue blue suede shoes
You can do anything but lay off of my blue suede shoes
