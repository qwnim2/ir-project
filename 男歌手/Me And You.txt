I like it when it's just me and you
I think by now you know it too
Not sorry if we ditch the crew
Just hope you feel the same way too
About me and you

There's not a thing that I wouldn't do
Ooh right now just to be here with you
I like you here in my arms
I like you here in my arms, ooh

What already happened
Feeling so lost and feeling so much distractions
沒有想過 你可以陪我度過
你安慰我的難過

在凌晨的街頭
模糊的角落
記得就在那時候
你微笑看著我

在那瞬間世界只剩你和我
享受在城市裡牽著你的手
而我 只想對你說
好像在電影中
男女主角相逢

I like it when it's just me and you

About me and you

There's not a thing that I wouldn't do
(What already happened, feeling so lost and)
There's not a thing that…
(Feeling so much distractions)
(沒有想過 你可以陪我度過)
(你安慰我的難過)

在凌晨的街頭
模糊的角落
記得就在那時候
你微笑看著我
(I like you here in my arms, yeah)

在那瞬間世界只剩你和我
享受在城市裡牽著你的手
而我 只想對你說
想要把這感受
永遠都能保留

I like it when it's just me and you
I think by now you know it too
Not sorry if we ditch the crew
Just hope you feel the same way too
About me and you
