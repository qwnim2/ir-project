作詞：李迪文
作曲：林俊傑

When I look up to the skies
Greet the sight before my eyes
And I welcome yet another glorious day
Every morning's bright sunrise
Never ceases to surprise
With the possibilities it brings my way

So into my life I go
Knowing everything I know
Hoping every moment in my day stays bright
As I follow my life's flow
I will carry on to grow
Just as long as life can let my dreams take flight

And as long as I believe what I believe
I can be all that I know all I can be
If I just allow
Love to lead the way, no matter how
I'll do my best, as I'm prepared to try
And I know if I believe what I believe
I will know that somehow I will be set free
From all that's in the way
It won't matter what they say

I'll do everything it takes
With the strength so that I may
Let my passion fly

This is what I've always known
I can't reach the skies alone
So I'll reach out to the ones who care for me
Till I know that I have grown
Till I'm standing on my own
With the love that leads me to my destiny

And as long as I believe what I believe
I can be all that I know all I can be
If I just allow
Love to lead the way, no matter how
I'll do my best, as I'm prepared to try
And I know if I believe what I believe
I will know that somehow I will be set free
From all that's in the way
It won't matter what they say
I'll do everything it takes
With the strength so that I may
Let my passion fly
