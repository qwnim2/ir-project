作詞：Kyler England
作曲：林俊傑

I've been going in circles
With no direction
Round and round I am spinning
Just when I think I'm moving forward
I discover
That I'm back at the beginning
But morning comes I see the sun rise
And it reminds me
Every day is a new day
And if it takes a million more tries
I'll never give up
I know I will find a way

Though it's hard to see
But the power is inside of me
If we dare to dream
I know we can do anything hey hey

Love is all we need
Together we'll fly Oh
To infinity and beyond
If we only believe
We can reach the sky Oh
To infinity and beyond

Oh oh oh
To infinity and beyond
Oh oh oh
To infinity and beyond

I've been going in circles
With no direction
Round and round I am spinning
