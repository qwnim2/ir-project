You called me from the room in your hotel
All full of romance for someone that you'd met
And telling me how sorry you were, leaving so soon
And that you miss me sometimes,
when you alone in your room
Do I feel lonely too？

You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
I can't go on, just holding on to ties
Now that we're living separate lives

Well I held on to let you go
and if you lost your love for me,
you never let it show, oh no
There was no way to compromise
So now we're living - now we're living
Separate lives

Ooh, it's so typical,
love leads to isolation
So you build that wall - you build that wall
Yes you build that wall
oh yes, you build that wall
And you make it stronger
You have no right to ask me how I feel
You have no right to speak to me so kind
Someday I might - I just might
find myself looking in your eyes
But for now
we'll go on living separate lives
Yes for now
we'll go on living separate lives

Separate lives
