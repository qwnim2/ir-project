Can'T Feel That Way Again
Arranger：Wayne Miller

It took a while to happen　But I woke up to you
The promises you made of love　You never saw them through
So darlin don't you cry
Tonight there's gonna be no lullabies for you and me...
Can't you see
Hey little girl　I'll make you understand
I can never feel never feel that way again

And now you believe
Hey little girl　I'll make you understand
I can never feel that way again
And now you believe...　Can't feel that way again
No more magic in our love affair　The dreams we had for two
One tragic night, it's finally over
Believe in bad love you're through　So darlin don't you cry
Tonight there's gonna be no lullabies for you
