Lyrics：Keith Carradine
Music：Keith Carradine

It's not my way to love you just when no one's looking
It's not my way to take your hand if I'm not sure
It's not my way to let you see what's going on inside of me
When it's love you won't be needing you're not free

Please stop pulling at my sleeve if you're just playing
If you won't take the things you make me want to give
I never cared too much for games and this one's driving me insane
You're not half as free to wander as you claim

But I'm easy
Yeah I'm easy
Give the word I'll play your game
As though that's how it ought to be because I'm easy

Don't lead me on if there's nowhere for you to take me
If loving you would have to be a sometime thing
I can't put bars on my insides my love is something I can't hide
It still hurts when I recall the times I try

But I'm easy
Yeah I'm easy

Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight because I'm easy

Don't do me favours let me watch you from a distance
Cause when you're near I find it hard to keep my head
And when your eyes throw light at mine it's enough to change my mind
Makes me leave my cautious words and ways behind

That's why I'm easy
Yeah I'm easy
Say you want me I'll come running without taking time to think

Cause I'm easy
Yeah I'm easy
Take my hand and pull me down
I won't put up any fight

Because I'm easy
Yeah I'm easy
Give the word I'll play your game as though that's how it ought to be
Because I'm easy



[中譯]
我很隨緣

我從不習慣﹐只有在沒有人看到的時候愛妳
我從不習慣﹐在不肯定的時候牽著妳的手
我從不習慣﹐讓妳看到我內心的感想
當妳不需要這份愛時妳並不自由

請別拉著我的衣袖﹐如果妳只是在鬧著玩
如果妳不會拿去那些妳令我願意付出的東西
我從不大熱衷遊戲﹐而這遊戲正令我顛狂
妳不能如妳所說般自由流浪
但我很隨緣
對﹐我很隨緣
告訴我妳的希望﹐我會把它來看成玩這遊戲的規則﹐
因為我很隨緣

請別引導我﹐如果妳根本不會帶我去任何地方
如果愛你必須只能是時有時無的
我不能將我的思想圈在鋼條內﹐我不能隱藏我的愛
當我想起多次的嘗試時依然覺得痛。
但我很隨緣
對﹐我很隨緣
拉著我的手把我拖下
我不會抵抗
因為我很隨緣

不要對我施緩手﹐讓我在遠距離看著妳
因為當妳接近我時我很難保持理性
妳那雙眼睛對我發放的光芒已足以令我改變注意
令我放棄謹慎的言行
因此我很隨緣
對﹐我很隨緣
說妳需要我﹐我會不加思索地奔向妳﹐因為我很隨緣
對﹐我很隨緣
拉著我的手把我拖下
我不會抵抗
因為我很隨緣
對﹐我很隨緣
告訴我妳的希望﹐我會把它來看成玩這遊戲的規則﹐
因為我很隨緣
