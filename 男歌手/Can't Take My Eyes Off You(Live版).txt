作詞：Frankie Valli
作曲：Frankie Valli

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you
You feel like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak

But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off you

I love you baby
And if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down, I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you Stay
So let me love you, baby
Let me love you(*)
