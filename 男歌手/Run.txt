Last night I had a dream
That I was on an endless run
I wasn't tired I wasn't scared
I couldn't stop but I didn't care

I ran through the night I ran through the rain
I ran and ran till everything looked the same
And it was then I passed the lake
At your reflection, I turned to ask

Can anyone tell
That I am lost

Can anyone tell
That I am naked before you
That I am burning for you

So there you were and I knew it was over
However beautiful however mad
Before I wake I just had to ask

Do you remember why you're here
Do you remember what
What in the world were you after
Or were you running away somehow

I woke up both happy and sad
A little sorry a little glad
