Lyrics：Del Shannon
Music：Del Shannon
Arranger：蘇德華

When I See You Walking Down The Street
I Get So Shaky And I feel So Weak
I Tell My Eyes Look The Other Way
But They Don't Listen To A Word I Say
And I Go To Pieces And I Almost Die
Evertime My Baby Passes By
I Tell My Arms To Hold Someone New
Another Love That Will Be True
But They Don't Listen
They Don't Seem To Care
They Reach For her But She's not there
And I Go To Pieces And I Wanna Hide
Go To Pieces and I Almost Die
Evertime My Baby Passes By

I Remember What You Said
When You Said Goodbye Baby
We'll Meet Again Soon Maybe
But Until We Do All My Best To You
I'm So Lonely I Think About You Only
I Go To Places We Used To Go
But I Know You'll Never Show
You Hurt Me So Much Inside
How I Hope You're Satisfide
And I Go To Pieces And I Wanna Hide
Go To Pieces And I Almost Die
Evertime My Baby Passes By
Go To Pieces And I,(And Die)
Go To Pieces And I,(Wanna Hide)
Go To Pieces And I,My Baby
