Lyrics：Fay Chou, Homan Chou

I know it's a small change
But coming from the heart
Every little bit becomes a lot
Helping and giving
For nothing in return
I want to do my part
And take my turn
For every kindness we show
Love will come back tenfold
That's when I started to know
That's when my heart began to grow
It's just a tiny flame
But a thousand light up the darkest night
I'm adding one more candle to the light

-Instrumental break-
For every kindness we show
Love will come back tenfold
That's when I started to know
That's when my heart began to grow
It's just a tiny flame
But a thousand light up the darkest night
I'm adding one more candle to the light
That's when I started to know
That's when my heart began to grow
It's just a tiny flame
But a thousand light up the darkest night
I'm adding one more candle to the light
I'm adding one more candle to the light
I'm adding one more candle to the light
