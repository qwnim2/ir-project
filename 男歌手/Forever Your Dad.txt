Sometimes life... doesn't work out the way you've planned.
Sometimes life... happens in ways too hard to understand.

The news that I received today
has taken all my breath away.
But I am promising you right now.
That I'll be with you always, somehow.
Either hand-in-hand or worlds apart
Standing by your side or in your heart
Maybe in a sunset or a prayer

When you go on your first date.
And can't figure out what to say.
When you get behind the wheel and
Have your first taste of freedom.
When you're smilin' for the camera.
At your high school formal dance and，
When you're walking across that stage.
With your whole future a blank page.
Please remember I'm going to be there

'Cause I promise you right now
That I'll be with you always, somehow.
Either hand-in-hand or worlds apart,
Standing by your side or in your heart
Face-to-face or as a memory
Keep your eyes open and you'll see
That through the good times and the bad

I will forever be your dad.

If you're tryin' to get ahead
But the results are better left unsaid.
And you're on the edge, about to quit
 'cause you just can't get the pieces to fit.
When your heart is broken by some fool
Who dunno know what he's done to you.
Or you just need some advice on life
'cause nothing seems to be going right.
You have to know I'll always be there...

 'Cause I promise you right now.
That I'll be with you always, somehow.
Either hand-in-hand or worlds apart,
Standing by your side or in your heart,
Face-to-face or as a memory
Keep your eyes open and you'll see
That through the good times and the bad
I will forever be your dad.
I will forever be your dad.

 'Cause I promise you right now
That I'll be with you always, somehow.
Either hand-in-hand or worlds apart,
Standing by your side or in your heart,
Face-to-face or as a memory,
Keep your eyes open and you'll see
That through the good times and the bad
I will forever be your dad.
