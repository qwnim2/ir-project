What is a youth!　Impetuous fire.
What is a maid!　Ice and desire.　The world wax on.
A rose will bloom.　It then will fade.
So does a youth.　So does the fairest maid.
Comes a time when one sweet smile had its season for a while.
Then love's in love with me.
Some they think only to marry.　Others will tease and tarry.
Mine is the very best parry.　Cupid he rules us all.
Caper the Caper, sing me the song.　Death will come soon to hush us along.
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall.　Love is a past time that never will fall.
Sweeter than honey and bitter as gall.　Cupid he rules us all.
