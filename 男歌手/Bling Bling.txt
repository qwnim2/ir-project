I wanner ride my motor bike,
i wanner shining your life,
bling bling to the left,
bling bling to the right,
i wanner give you little love,
i got the feeling
gonna keep on moving, my baby

I wanner ride my motor bike,
i wanner shining your life,
bling bling to the left,
bling bling to the right,
i wanner give you little love,
i got the feeling
gonna keep on moving, my baby
