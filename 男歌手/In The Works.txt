People like to assume what I know
What Iʼve done and told
The things that Iʼve wrote

Hey I could never do it
If it wasnʼt for the bullet
That hit right in my chest
That hit right in my chest

I got a lot of broken stories in my mind
I got a lot of broken parts to combine
I used to love with no holdbacks
I used to trust with no regrets

In my mind
浩瀚星海 願我陪伴 你的孤單
哪怕遠在 光年之外 哪怕粉碎光環
我的未來 比誰都明白
So don't even try to stop me woah
Oh~ Yeah~ No regrets

People like to assume what I know
What Iʼve done and told
The things that Iʼve wrote

Hey I could never do it
If it wasnʼt for the bullet
That hit right in my chest
That hit right in my chest

I got a lot of broken stories in my mind
I got a lot of broken parts to combine
I used to love with no holdbacks
I used to trust with no regrets

In my mind
浩瀚星海 願我陪伴 你的孤單
哪怕遠在 光年之外 哪怕消逝黑暗
我的未來 比誰都明白
So don't even try to stop me woah

People like to assume what I know
人家都說不出來什麼知道
What Iʼve done and told
什麼我們在那裡的問題說
The things that Iʼve wrote
上單但是是否真的假的真不了
Hey I could never do it
Hey得適合生三年如廁
If it wasnʼt for the bullet
說的那樣子的為別讓
That hit right in my chest
檔案定義氣順
That hit right in my chest
身囧囧將單順
I got a lot of broken stories in my mind
我們不受屏蔽父母雞塊石頭門見面
I got a lot of broken parts to combine
我們不受屏蔽罩衫房東東西嗎個月
I used to love with no holdbacks
我單位置優越感覺
I used to trust with no regrets
我說嘛煩
In my mind
浩瀚星海 願我陪伴 你的孤單
哪怕遠在 光年之外 哪怕粉碎光環
我的未來 比誰都明白
So don't even try to stop me woah
Oh~ Yeah~ No regrets

People like to assume what I know
What Iʼve done and told
The things that Iʼve wrote


Hey I could never do it
If it wasnʼt for the bullet
That hit right in my chest
That hit right in my chest

I got a lot of broken stories in my mind
I got a lot of broken parts to combine
I used to love with no holdbacks
I used to trust with no regrets

In my mind
浩瀚星海 願我陪伴 你的孤單
哪怕遠在 光年之外 哪怕消逝黑暗
我的未來 比誰都明白
So don't even try to stop me woah
