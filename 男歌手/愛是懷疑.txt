yo
yo i got somethin' to say
you know sometimes
when you get all pissed at me
when you're like not talking to me
well
sometimes love is just a game
just like anything else
you gotta know what you want
and the rest doesn't really matter
cus sometimes
you just gotta put things in perspective
then maybe you can understand
like why we're doing the stuff we're doing to each other
and sometimes
you just gotta learn to take it easy
you know what i'm saying
cus

若能表白　我心中的依賴
你我當初也不必那麼哀
若能敞開　把真相說出來
這一段故事不會太精采

種種意外　若能夠明白
那生存意義又何在
若能推猜　這一切的未來
我乾脆辭掉工作買大彩

Because 愛是妒忌　愛是懷疑
愛是種近乎幻想的真理
Because 愛是遊戲　愛能叛逆
So! 別把這遊戲看得太仔細　No! No!

It's like sometimes I don't even know who I am anymore
Can't see what's the point of being in love anymore
It's a game what a shame
You make it lame by going insane about it
This love ain't what you say about it
It's about what you do about it
So get with it, stick with it
If you still can't understand well, than forget about it
Sometimes all you do to me is sulk,
like you got something to say
But nothing makes sense when you move your lips
All you do is get pissed at me
Dissed at me
Wonder why you're still here with me
Sometimes all you do to me is sulk,
like you got something to say
But nothing makes sense when you move your lips
All you do is get pissed at me
Damn
Take it easy

Because 愛是遊戲　愛能叛逆
So! 別把這遊戲看得太仔細　No ～
