Written：Frank Musker/Richard Darbyshire

I can feel the night upon my skin and I can't sleep
You know I want you, you know I want you
I can feel the fire, my desire burns so deep
I need to love you,to feel you want me too

And I never knew I could love you this way
And I want you more than I ever could say
Don't make me wait, baby do it again
Over and over again

(Chorus)
Your lips, speak without, speak without words
I can feel you deep inside of me
Feel my body sweetly lose control
Speak without, speak without words
When we kiss I feel the mystery
Touch my body and my soul

In the velvet silence I reach out to touch your skin
And there is magic, in every part of me

When I hear your voice inside my head and I begin
To understand your secret poetry

And I never knew I could love you this way
And I want you more than I ever could say
Please baby, please baby, do it again
Over and over again

(Chorus)
Your lips, speak without, speak without words etc.

And I nevr knew that your love was so strong
And I never knew it could last so long
I'm gonna do everything that you want
Tonight, oh baby,just reach out

(Spanish chorus)　Tus Labios, habian En to poder mi
entrego a la passion
Haslan sin,Hablan sin decir Tu me resas y te biento aqui
En fundo do mi corazon
