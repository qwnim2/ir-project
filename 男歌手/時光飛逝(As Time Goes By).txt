Lyrics：Herman Hupfeld
Music：Herman Hupfeld

You must remember this
A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh.
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by.

And when two lovers woo
They still say, 'I love you.'
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by.

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date.
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate.
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
There's no one can deny.

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die

The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by.

And when two lovers woo
They still say, 'I love you.'
On that you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by.

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date.
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate.
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
There's no one can deny.

It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by.
