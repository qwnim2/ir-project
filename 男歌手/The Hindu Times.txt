作詞：Noel Gallagher
作曲：Noel Gallagher

I get up when I'm down I can't swim but my soul won't drown
I do believe I've got flare I've got speed and I walk on air

'Cos God gave me his soulin your rock 'n' roll babe
'Cos God gave me his soulin your rock 'n' roll babe
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it

In and out my brain Running through my veins
You're my sunshine You're my rain

There's a light That shines on Shines on me
And it keeps me warm
It give me peace
I must say
I can't sleep

'Cos the world won't wait 'Cos God gave me a soul
In your rock 'n' roll babe 'Cos God gave me a soul
In your rock 'n' roll babe
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it

In and out my brain Running through my veins
You're my sunshine You're my rain

And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it
And I get so high I just can't feel it

In and out my brain Running through my veins
You're my sunshine You're my rain
