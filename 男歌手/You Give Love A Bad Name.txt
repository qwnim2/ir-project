作曲：Desmond Child、Richie Sambora、Jon Bon Jovi

An angel's smile is what you sell
You promise me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free

Oh, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name

I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
And you give love a bad name

You paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye

Oh, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me
The damage is done

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame

You give love a bad name

I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love

Oh, shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name

I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name

Shot through the heart
And you're to blame
You give love a bad name

I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name

You give love
You give love a bad name
You give love
You give love a bad name

You give love
You give love a bad name
