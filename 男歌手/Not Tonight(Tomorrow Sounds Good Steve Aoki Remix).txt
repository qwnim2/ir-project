Shouldn't walk on my own

Without you it's so cold here

No one's lighting my phone up

I'm a little obsessed

Maybe it's hard to forget you

Get you off of my chest yeah


I… I shouldn't be here

I… I should be running to you I'm coming


I lost my faith for a minute

Told everybody I was over you

We had nothing else to lose

I left myself unforgiven

Got to the edge of almost falling through

Almost walked away from you


But not tonight

I can't leave you now

I can't leave you no

No matter how hard I try


Not tonight

I can't leave you now

I can't leave you no

No matter how hard even harder I'll try

Not tonight

Not tonight

Not tonight

Not tonight


Used to call myself strong

How did we get so far gone here

Buried under my flaws

I don't know if we'll have tomorrow

If we're barely holding today

All of these seconds feel borrowed so late
