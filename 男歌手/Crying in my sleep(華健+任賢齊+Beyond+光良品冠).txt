Lyrics：Teasdale/Brian(Red)/Collinson/Dean

I took a walk around the yard
I dug the flowers till it got too hard
Smoked my first pack of cigarettes today
Then I, I went down, down to Lucy's old cafe I put a half
a case away
Took a sleeping pill and I tried to watch TV
But you know baby, the leading lady
Looked too much like you for the likes of me And I woke
up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
I knocked the phone off the night stand
And the operator said, ' Can I help you please？'
And I said ' No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me.'
You see I just had a bad dream
That's all that's wrong with me
You see I just had a bad dream
Went out to loosen up the car

Somehow I wound up at the Rainbow Bar
I had a scotch and soda on the run
But didn't get too far Then I, I ran down, down some friends
I used to know
I dragged them out to see the show
I ran myself a bath and I tried to read your book But you
know baby,
this time it just didn't seem Worth all the time
it look
And I woke up crying in my sleep
I was talking to your pillow
And I reached out to touch your hand
I knocked the phone off the night stand
And the operator said, ' Can I help you please？'
And I said'No thanks baby, tonight there ain't no help for me.'
You see I just had a bad dream
That's all that's wrong with me
You see I just had a bad dream
