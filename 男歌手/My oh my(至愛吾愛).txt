Lyrics：James Lea/Neuille Holder

I believe in women, my oh my
I believe in lovin', my oh my
Don't a woman need a man
Try and catch one if you can
I believe in women, my oh my
We all need a someone to talk to my oh my
We all need a someone to talk to my oh my
Ya need a shoulder to cry on
Call me I'll be standing by
We all need a someone to talk to my oh my
We all need a lot of lovin' my oh my
Year, a whole lot of lovin' my oh my
I can lend a helpin' hand
If you ain't got nothing planned
We all need some lovin' my oh my
So let's all swing together my oh my
We can all swing together my oh my
You've got troubles on your own

No need to face them all alone
We can all swing together my oh my
So let's all pull together my oh my
So let's all pull together my oh my
We can ride the stormy weather
If we all get out and dry
So let's all pull together my oh my
So let's all pull together my oh my...

So let's all swing together my oh my
We can all swing together my oh my
You've got troubles on your own
No need to face them all alone
We can all swing together my oh my

So let's all swing together my oh my
So let's all swing together my oh my
