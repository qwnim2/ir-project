I remember all my life　Raining down as cold as ice
Shadows of a man, a face through a window
Crying in the night, the night goes into morning
Just another day, happy people pass my way
Looking in their eyes I see a memory
I never realized how happy you made me Oh MANDY

Well you came and you gave without taking
But I sent you away Oh MANDY

Well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking
And I need you today　Oh MANDY

I'm standing on the edge of time
I've walked away when love was mine
Caught up in a world of uphill climbing
The tears in my eyes　And nothing is rhyming
Yesterday's a dream　I face the moring
Crying on a breeze　The pain is calling
