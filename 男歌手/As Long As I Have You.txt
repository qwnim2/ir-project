Lyrics：王力宏
Music：王力宏

Everything that you are And everything that you do
Fills me with hope and love I want you to know that I love you
Thoughts of you fill my mind And brighten up every day
My dreams of a perfect love Coming true in so many ways
And I know I can't be wrong To say that together we belong
And think of the times We've seen each other through
Tell me if the song Should ever get weary or too long
That everything will calm As long as I have you
Your kisses are just like sunshine Melting away the winter snow and
Suddenly life awakens Reminding me you're the best woman I know
And I know I can't be wrong To say that together we belong
And think of the times We've seen each other through
Tell me if the song Should ever get weary or too long
That everything will calm As long as I have you
