Arranger：陳志昆/洪敬堯/廖世錚
Artist：Mandy Gaines

(EMIL) There were times when I did not know what to do
That's when you said that you could show me
(MANDY) Now I find my life has changed because of you
I knew it would when you said hold me
(合) I can feel it rising with the sun
Shinig pure just like the morning light
I'm so very sure that you're the one for me　(EMIL)
Baby your love has set me free

(MANDY) Though the time that's past has not been much at all
I feel like I've known you since forever
(EMIL) I remember well the very day you called
So easy we fell in love together
(MANDY) I never thought that love could be like this　(EMIL)
It took me beyond my expectations
(MANDY) It's never the same when I feel your kiss　(EMIL)
I want to thank you but can't find the words
Baby your love has set me free
