Outside the rain begins and it may never end
So cry no more on the shore
A dream will take us out to sea forever more, forever more
Close your eyes, and dream, and you can be with me
Neath the waves, through the caves of hours
Long forgotten now, we're all alone, we're all alone
Close the window, calm the light and it will be all right
No need to bother now　Let it out, let it all begin
Learn how to pretend
Once a story's told it can't help but grow old
Roses do lovers too　So cast your seasons to the wind
And hold me dear, oh, hold me dear
Close the window, calm the light and it will be all right
No need to bother now, let it out, let it all begin
All's forgotten now, my love, we're all alone, we're all alone
