作曲：Marvin Gaye

Woo ah, mercy mercy me
Ah things ain't what they used to be
no no~Where did all the blue skies go
Poison is the wind that blows
from the north and south and east

Woo mercy, mercy me,
Ah things ain't what they used to be
Oil wasted on the ocean
and upon our seas, fish full of mercury

Ah oh mercy, mercy me

Ah things ain't what they used to be,
Radiation under ground and in the sky
Animals and birds who live nearby are dying

Oh mercy, mercy me
Ah things ain't what they used to be
What about this overcrowded land
How much more abuse from man can she stand?
