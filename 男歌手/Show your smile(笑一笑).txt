Lyrics：Homan Chou
Music：Wa Kin

When you're really mad
You want to yell out bad
Don't you wish you felt the way you did when you were glad？
When you're really sad
It makes you want to cry
But crying makes your throat hurt and it makes you really tired
Show your smile once a while, even for pretend
You will find(that)head held high

You are happy in the end
When you're really scared
It makes you want to scream
But screaming gets you yelled at when it's not an emerency
When you're feeling good
There's happiness inside
It makes you feel that all it right
It makes you want to fly
