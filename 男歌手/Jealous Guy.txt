I was dreaming of the past 　 And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control 　 I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you 　 I'm sorry that I make you cry
I didn't want to hurt you 　 I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure that 　 You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside 　 I was shivering inside
Oh I didn't mean to hurt you 　 I'm sorry that I made you cry
I dodn't want to hurt you 　 I'm just a jealous guy
I was trying to catch your eyes 　 I thought that you would try to hide
I was swallowing my pain 　 I was swallowing my pain
I didn't mean to hurt you 　 I'm sorry that I made you cry
I dodn't want to hurt you 　 I'm just a jealous guy
