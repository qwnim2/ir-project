Everyday when I think I see her ( I want to meet her )
But I turn the other way
And all the time I wanna say something to her ( say something to her )
But I wait another day ( hey )
And everyday I try hard not to stare ( not that she'd care )
But I'm too shy to act on a care
And if I find that she can't be mine ( she's not my kind )
Then I would be wasting my time . . .
I would be wasting my time
They all tell me just to speak my mind

And let my mouth unwind　to act real gental and kind
I don't think I'm ready yet to call her mine
I don't think it's time　And it's easier said then done
And No I can't remember　And No I can't remember
And No I can't remember　No I can't remember my life
And everyday I've got a present to give her ( present to give her )
But I put the present away
And everyday when I think I miss her ( I want to kiss her )
But I keep my distance and wait
Until a day when I've got something to say
That will be my happiest day . . .
That will be my happiest day . . .
