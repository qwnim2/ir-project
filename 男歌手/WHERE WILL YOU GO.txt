We started out simple friends
That kind of friendship never ends, no baby
But we were fortunate to care enough
We knew just where we stood
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so insecure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away
And you were certain that
In time my love would stray

Where, where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you like I do
Where, where will you go
And who's gonna love like I do

What kind of friends could we have been
If we had kkept the feelings in
When we had made the vow
to be the friends
We were since we began
But soon as love appeared
You turned away
And you were so insecure and so afraid
Of feeling what I was feeling
You were scared that love
Would blow your heart away

And you were certain that
In time my love
You were thinkin' that my love
was gonna stray
Oh tell me

Where will you go
And who, who's gonna love you baby
The way that I do, now baby
Where, where will you go,
where will you go
And tell me who is gonna love
I wanna know who is gonna love
I need to know who is gonna love
Who's gonna love, who, who, who, oh
Where, where will you go baby
Who's gonna love you baby, tell me
Who's gonna care for you baby
Who's gonna be there for you baby
Who's gonna love you like
you need to be loved
Oh where will you go baby
And who's gonna love you like I do
Oh I wanna know I wanna know
I wanna know
Like I do
Trust never came between us
