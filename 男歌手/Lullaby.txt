Sleep , lay me down　Hold me closely in your arms
And I will close my eyes
Please promise me that　When I wake up from my dreams
You'll be there by my side
Love if you say , you won't slip away
Then I can go dreaming of forever more
But I won't rest until I know that
You will be here in the morning be my side
