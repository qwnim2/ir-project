My heart can't stand the pain knowing that you're playing around.
I know one love is not the same.　And losing you is getting me down.
And now I sit and cry alone, wondering what went wrong.
Asking myself why you're gone but in the end when all said and done.
I'll just kiss you once then I'll go.　Babe I wish that I could stay.
I'll just kiss you once kiss you once then I'll know.　Babe I wish love will find a way.
I tried to ease my mind, ring me on this telephone line.
Hold my tears in time.　Your sentences are so hard to hide...
But still I sit and cry alone, hoping that you'll come home.
And though I realize you're gone if we should meet sometime to come.
