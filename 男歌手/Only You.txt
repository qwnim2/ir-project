Only you
Can make a11 this world seem right
Only you
can make the darkness bright
Only you and you alone can thrill me like you do.
And fill my heart with love for only you.

Only you
can make this change in me.
For it's true you are my destiny.
When you hold my hand, I understand.
The magic that you do.

You're my dream come true.
My one and only you.

Only you
can make this change in me.
For it's true you are my destiny.
When you hold my hand, I understand.
The magic that you do.
You're my dream come true.
My one and only you.
