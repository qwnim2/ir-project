Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough, so tough

Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man
She brings home her pay
For love, for love

She says, 'We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot'

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer

Tommy got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk
So tough, it's tough

Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers
'Baby, it's okay, some day'

We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love, we'll give it a shot

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when it's all that you've got

We're half way there
Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Livin' on a prayer
