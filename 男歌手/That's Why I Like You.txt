You're the one that
I've been looking for
Good hearted
Cute and beautiful

I can't take my eyes off you
Cuz you're the reason
That I think I'm falling

In love with you
In love with you
In love with you
In love with you

Girl I can be your sunshine
You can be my blue sky
I'm falling for your brown eyes
Easy going my type
I like your imperfection
I like our crazy laughter
I like my world better
When I'm here with you

That's why I like you
That's why I like you
That's why I like you
That's why I like you
That's why I like you

You're the one that
I've been looking for
Good hearted
Cute and beautiful
