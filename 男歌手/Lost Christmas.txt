I wish Christmas could be good again
That you could forget everything
Just for one day I'd take you right back
To when you were a little girl
To when each day promised you pearls
Before you grew up

(Bridge)
And I wish that we owned the house we live in

And I wish that we had no bills to pay
And I wish I could find something this Christmas
Something so valuable that it didn't cost

(Chorus)
Happy Christmas to you
May all your dreams come true
And may somebody save you tonight
And may you still believe that I might
And may some things just turn out all right
