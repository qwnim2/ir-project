Lyrics：Jim Croce
Music：Jim Croce
Arranger：Jim Croce

Well, I know it's kind of late
I hope I didn't wake you
But what I got to say can't wait
I know you'll understand
Everytime I try to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I have to say I love you in a song

You know it's kind of strange
Everytime I'm near you
I just run out of things to say
I know you understand
Everytime I try to tell you

The words just came out wrong
So I have to say I love you in a song

Everytime the time is right
All the words just came out wrong
So I have to say I love you in a song
You know it's kind of late
I hope I didn't wake you
But there's something that I just got to say
I hope you understand
Everytime I try to tell you
The words just came out wrong
So I have to say I love you in a song
So I have to say I love you in a song
