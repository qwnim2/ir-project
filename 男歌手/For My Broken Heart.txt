(Reba)There were no angry words at all
As we carried boxes down the hall
One by one put them in your car
(Jacky)Nothing much for us to say
One last goodbye and you drove away
I watched your tail-lights　As they faded in the dark
(Reba)I couldn't face the night in that lonely bed
So I laid down on the couch instead

(Chorus) (duet)　Last night I prayed the lord my soul to keep
Then I cried myself to sleep　So sure life wouldn't go on without you

But oh this sun is blinding me　As it wakes me from the dark
I guess the world didn't stop　For my broken heart
(Jacky)Clock stiil tickin', life goes on
Radio still plays a song　As I try to put my scattered thoughts in place
(Reba)And it takes all the strength I've got
To stumble to the coffee pot
The first many lonely mornings I've got to face
(Jacky)You call to see if I'm ok
Look out the window and I just say　Repeat chorus
(Reba)For my broken heart
(Jacky)I guess the world ain't gonna stop　For my broken heart
