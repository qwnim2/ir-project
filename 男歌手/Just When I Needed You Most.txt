You packed in the morning and I
Stared out the window and I
Struggled for something to say
You left in the rain without closing the door
I didn't stand in your way
Now I miss you more than I 　 Miss you before and now
Where I'll find comfort God knows
Cause you left me just when I needed you most
Now most every morning I 　 Stare out the window and I
Think about where you might be
I've written you letters that I'd like to send
If you would just send one to me
'Cos I need you more than I 　 Needed before and now
When I'll find comfort God knows
Cause you left me just when I needed you most
