And when you rise in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wander far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again

*
when you come to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love ( x 3)
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me*

I believe in you
You know the door to my barest soul
You're the light in my deepest darkest hour

You're my saviour when I fall
And you may not think that I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love (x 3)
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

repeat *

How deep is your love how deep is your love
I really need to learn
Cause we're living in a world of fools
Breaking us down when they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
