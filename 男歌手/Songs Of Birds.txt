How did you know I had a needing heart
You made me glad
In your pureness of your eyes
I felt such a power
It gave me the strength to go on
Now I know I really feel in my heart
more than all the sun e'r released in all it's hours

Believing in you
believing in me
believing in love

{Songs of birds)} Songs of birds fill the air
The autumn hues everywhere
There's a sense of love and peace
I feel where I am being with you as we are

All the trouble in the world won't scare me
if I'm right there with you through it all

Believing in you
believing in me
believing in love

Now I know I really feel in my heart
more than all the sun e'r released in all it's hours

Believing in you
believing in me
believing in love
