Could be wrong 　 How do I know 　 Now you're gone
I'm feeling low 　 Heard you say 　 You'd never leave 　 Can I believe you
Yesterday you were with me 　 Went away leaving me free
Heard you say you'd never leave 　 Can I believe you
How can I believe everything you say
How can I believe you won't go away
Doesn't have to be fore eternity
You can still feel free with me
When you're here 　 I feel secure
In your arms 　 I feel so sure 　 Could be wrong
How do I know 　 Can I believe you
How can I believe anything ( everything ) you say
How can I believe you won't go away
Doesn't have to be for eternity
You can still feel free with me
