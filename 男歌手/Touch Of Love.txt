Tis the season now, for gifts and giving all
The love our hearts and dreams can afford
And when I think about
That the hope that you've handed out
I want to give back all I have and then some more

But I'm only human, I can only do so much
But all the miracles we need
Is just one touch

From me from you
Helping someone who can't make it on their own
No one wants to be alone at a time like this
Only joy should exist
When the world gets too much
All we need, all we need is a touch of love
A touch of love

When hard times appear
When we drown in our tears
There's faith enough to see us through
Whatever rains on us
We can always trust
That heaven's hand will guide us through

Yeah we're only human, we can all do so much

All the miracles we need
Is just one touch
Yeah just one touch

From me from you
Helping someone who can't make it on their own
No one wants to be alone at a time like this
Only joy should exist
When the world gets too much
All we need, all we need is a touch of love

It took a child to touch the world
Just think what we can do
Think of the miracles

From me from you
Helping someone who can't make it on their own
No one wants to be alone at a time like this
Only joy should exist
When the world gets too much
All we need, all we need is a touch of love
Is a touch of love

All I need, heaven need
Is a touch of love
All I need, heaven need
Is a touch of love
Is a touch of love
