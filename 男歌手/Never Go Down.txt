Alone in the city　Ain't no streets of gold
Wallowing in self pity　In a world so hard and cold
Walking the streets in vain　To find a friendly face
But all I got was pain　And was lost wthout a trace
Bridge　Scared and alone　I didn't have the strength
to carry on　I thought that I would never win this fight
Took solace in my loneliness　But now I see the light
(Chorus)　Coz-I-oh I-oh I　I'm never going down again
I said I-oh I-oh I　I'm never going down again
I 've danced with the devil　I have prayed to the Lord

Drowned in a sea of sorrrow
My joie da vivre was searching for salvation from on high
But hope springs enternal like true love
And I made a vow somewhere, somehow
That I would rise above　(Chorus)　Coz-I-oh I-oh I
I'm never going down again　I said I-oh I-oh I
I'm never going down again　Looked to the sky I was
searching for salvation from on high　But hope springs
enternal like true love　And I made a vow somewhere,
somehow　That I would rise above　(Chorus)
Coz-I-oh I-oh I　I'm never going down again
