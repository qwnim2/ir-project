作詞：王力宏/Joshua P.Thompson
作曲：王力宏/Joshua P.Thompson

I keeps it versatile, cause that is my style　From hip-hop to be-bop
I been with shorties round the world　Variety is just my personality
Sometimes I just don't fit in　I see the open doorways
But no one wants to let me in
Grandma made me understandmaterial thins don't make the man,
Try to Find that inner wealth and learn to love yourself
Lately it's so hard to find peace of mind
I just got to get away from the haters and the instigators
The mis-conceivers and the non-believers
People don't believe the hype 'cause Leehom ain't no stereo type

No Crystale in the tub (No)
Or iced out Spreewell dubs (No)
I'm really not your average thug (No no)
Not your average gangster
And I won't be defined by the size of my knot
But the state of my mind
No Rolex on my wrist
Or platinum on my chest
'Cause I don't need that sh to impress
But y'all don't get it twisted,
I got love for the ghetto
Tho I'm not your average thug

(Feel me) Lord I been around the world
Sangin' near and far
People runnin' game all over,
Judgin' me before we meet when they see me on the street
Andthey don't know a damn thing about me
It's a world of jealousy deceit and envy
Seems like everybody tryin' to take something from me
Grandma made me understnad material things don't make the man,
so I found that inner wealth and learned to love myself
Lately it's so hard to find peace of mind (lately it is so had)
I just got to get away from the haters and the instigators
There's back-stabbers and money-grabbers,
users and abusers and they all wear smilin' faces_

No Crystale in the tub (No)

Or iced out Spreewell dubs (No)
I'm really not your average thug (No no)
Not your average gangster
And I won't be defined by the size of my knot
But the state of my mind
No Rolex on my wrist
Or platinum on my chest
'Cause I don't need that sh to impress
But y'all don't get it twisted,
I got love for the ghetto
Tho I'm not your average thug

Sometimes I feel like I'm gonna snap,
and go off up in this piece on somebody,
I ain't tryin' to say no names,
but I ain't tryin' to play no games,
holla if you feel me people
Lately it's so hard to find peace of mind,
so lift me up in a lonely world that's so unkind
there's back-stabbers and money-grabbers,
users and abusers and they all wear smilim' faces_

No Crystale in the tub (No)
Or iced out Spreewell dubs (No)
I'm really not your average thug
Not your average gangster
And I won't be defined by the size of my knot
But the state of my mind
No Rolex on my wrist
Or platinum on my chest
'Cause I don't need that sh to impress
But y'all don't get it twisted,
I got love for the ghetto
Tho I'm not your average thug

(Shorties I just need that ghetto love, Take a dip im my jacuzzi,
 Don't misjudge me, 'cause I'm my own now, Sometimes I don't even
 wear no watch, Everybody needs some ghetto love, see I'm not your
 average thug)
