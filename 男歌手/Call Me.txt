Lyrics：Deyoung/Dennis
Music：Deyoung/Dennis

Rain began to fall softly
As she gazzed around the room
Even now she wondered what went wrong
A letter in her hand trembled
As she placed it by the phone
All at once there were footsteps by the door
She didn't want a confrontation
To tear them apart
She wasn't sure of the feelings
Racing through her heart

I looked into her eyes
Knowing something wasn't right
And suddenly the tears began to show
How I wish I could tell you that I am
But before I even read this letter
I want you to stay
But if I see your mind's made up
There's one thing I've got to say

You can call me
Baby if you ever change your mind
Believe me when I say to you
Anytime will be alright

You can call me
Only seven numbers on the phone
Maybe we can talk things over
You're never that far from home
Oh,no no baby you're not alone

Another season
Another change
Two hearts are breaking
With no one to blame

I know the reasons
You want to go
But if you find that you still want me
There's one thing that you know
