It's a heartache, nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game, nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown
It's a heartache, nothing but a heartache
Love until your arms break
Then she'll let you down

It ain't right with love to share

When you find she doesn't care for you
It ain't wise to need someone
As much as I depended on you
It's a heartache, nothing but a heartache
Hits you when it's too late
Hits you when you're down
It's a fool's game, nothing but a fool's game
Standing in the cold rain
Feeling like a clown, it's a heartache
