I see you everywhere at where we use to be
I see laughters I see fights that we don't mean
I see you everywhere even in my dreams
But I would wake up with no one next to me

So would you come back to me
Where everything are what we use to be
Do you still think of me
Cuz all I know and all I know this love is driving me crazy

Oh I can't sleep I can't breathe
Cuz all I see and all I see is you
Oh I can't sleep I can't breathe
Cuz all I need and all I need is you

I see you everywhere at where we use to be
I see laughters I see fights that we don't mean

Oh I can't sleep I can't breathe
Cuz all I see and all I see is you
Oh I can't sleep I can't breathe
Cuz all I need is you
