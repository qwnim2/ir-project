Lyrics：Homan Chou

Something happened and my world was changed
Some people looked on while my eyes were glazed
Then a new friend came and showed me how
I could put my feet back on the ground

A little love, a little kindness can save me
You inspired me to keep going on
Life is harsh and you took me to safety
Now it's my turn to pass it on…

So I stand up
I will give back a helping hand
I will open my heart again
I'll remember the worst I was in was not the end
Never give up
Help is never that far away
We're not alone so we're not afraid
Moving forward with hearts and minds
One day at a time

We tend to focus on the things we lose
It's hard to see things from another view
In this busy world we're running around
I took a chance and then I found…

A little love, a little kindness can save me
You inspired me to keep going on
