Couple of times turned to every night there was only us
Till you shot me down, when I wasn't around you were messing up

You try
And say you're coming by
I'm breaking inside
But I got no room for you

Cuz I leveled
I pulled myself together
I'm doing so much better
Now I got no room for you, for you

When you pull me close I
Lose myself in your eyes
You take hold of my mind
Trying to get through

Now you're coming back here
Knocking on my heart sphere
I won't let you past, there's
No room for you

You're so persuasive, I feel myself changing with every touch
You're so amazing, you'll save me before you run out of love

You try
And say you're coming by
I'm breaking inside
But I got no room for you

Cuz I leveled
I pulled myself together
I'm doing so much better
Now I got no room for you, for you

When you pull me close I
Lose myself in your eyes
You take hold of my mind
Trying to get through

Now you're coming back here
Knocking on my heart sphere
But I won't let you past, there's
No room for you
