Lyrics：Homan Chou
Music：Wa Kin

What goes around comes around
And knocks you senseless to the ground
You regret the words you found
Your voice and your sound
Oh I know you didn't mean what you said
But I couldn't help feeling like I was dead
Don't want to make believe
I'm faceless, nameless in your dream
Ah hoo hoo whoa
Wake up and seek the truth
Say I want it to be you
Ah hoo hoo whoa
We can find like we're right beside
And try to read between the lines

If only we could find a sign to let us know that it was time
If I were not me and you were not you
Could there possibly be a chance for us two？
Don't want to make believe
I'm faceless, nameless in your dream
Ah hoo hoo whoa
Wake up and seek the truth
Say I want it to be you
Ah hoo hoo whoa
Don't want to make believe
I'm faceless, nameless in your dream
Ah hoo hoo whoa
Wake up and seek the truth
Say I want it to be you
Ah hoo hoo whoa
