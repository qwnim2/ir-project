And I think I finally know you
I can see beyond your smile
I think that I can shoe you that
What we have is still worthwhile
Don't you know that love's like a thread
That keeps us unravelling
And then it ties back together in the end
* In your eyes I can see my dream reflections
In your eyes I found the answers to my questions
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes we're drifting safely back to shore
I think I've finally learned to love you more

And you warned me that life changes
And that no one really knows
Whether time will make us strangers
or whether time will make us grow
Eventhough the winds of time will change
In a world where nothing stays the same
Through it all our love will still remain 　 ( Repeat ) *
In your eyes I can see the reasons why our love's alive
In your eyes we're drifting safely back to shore
I think I've finally learned to love you more
