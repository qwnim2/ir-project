Ｊ：Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
　　It seems the natural thing to do
Ｃ：Tonight, no one's gonna find us
　　We'll leave the world behind us
C,Y:When I make love to you

Ｊ：Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
　　And Hope that deep inside you feel it too
Ｃ：Tonight, Our spirits will be climbing
C,Y:To a sky lit up with diamonds
　　Tonight....

* C,Ｊ：Tonight, I celebrate my love for you
　　　　And that midnight sun
　　　　Is gonna come shining through
