The lights are on-but you're not home your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep, you can't eatã€€your throat is tight, you can't breathe
There's no doubt-you're in deep another kiss is all you need

You like to think that you're immune to the stuff on yeah?
It's closer to the truth you know gonna have to face it
Gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

You see the Signs-but you can't read You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double-time another kiss and you'll be mine
A one-track mind; you can't be saved another young love is All you crave
if there's some left for you You don't mind if you do

You like to think that you're immune to the stuff-oh yeah?
It's closer to the truth you know gonna have to tace it
Might as well face it you're addicted to love
