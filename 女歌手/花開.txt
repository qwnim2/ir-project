I can hear
It's falling down
You
Hello
Come here
Will you

On my way to baby grandma
I read
I shrink
I read

Smoke' em if you got' em darling
Coz it's rare
Coz it heals
It heals

The world will fall
I'll fall
The stars will fall
印象之花綻放

Blossom all around

Let it come what may
Come but not from your past
Let it come what may
Come only as you are

I can hear
It's falling down
I can see
It's all around
印象之花綻放

I can hear
It's falling down
印象之花綻放

I can hear
It's falling down
I can see
It's all around
I can see
