LA La la....

wish i had a colour tv set
I'd sit around all day
and let the day turn into night
funny people playin up today
what a joke it is
for them to see me from their screen
LA La la...

I wake in the mornin juz to see the sun
looked at the window to see people passing by
but nothin! juz nothin!

i think abt the things to do
i think abt my colourful sweet baby!!

wish i had a coloured tv set
stay up late at night
don't care what happens there and then
I'm sick of people knockin at the door
juz me my tv set
will stick together thru the times...

LA La la.....
