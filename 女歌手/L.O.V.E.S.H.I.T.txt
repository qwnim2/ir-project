If my baby left me
Oh I'd feel just like a fool
Hollywood makes it seem
Like love's always a dream
And I never wanna wake up

Put on some Superwoman
Cos I wanna hear Karyn sing
Put on Marvin Gaye, Macy Gray
Dr. Dre's Friday
I'm an old school kinda girl

Baby you know it
I'm all about it
Feel like that girl singin' Nintendo Shawty
Baby let's party
ASAP A-S-A-P
I think you're my kinda guy

I'm on that L-O-V-E-S-H-I-T
Easy come easy go
B-b-baby you know
My love is all you need

Don't say you love me
Like I've never been loved before

You'll never break my heart
Too much of a sweetheart
You wouldn't even kill a fly

Baby you know it
I'm all about it
Feel like that girl singin' Nintendo shawty
Baby let's party
ASAP A-S-A-P
I think you're my kinda guy

I'm on that L-O-V-E-S-H-I-T
Easy come easy go
B-b-baby you know
My love is all you need

I'll be alright
You'll be just fine
If you stop hustlin' your love will be mine
Cos I'm tryna kick it
Don't get complicated
Baby I'm tryna chill

I'm on that L-O-V-E-S-H-I-T
Easy come easy go
B-b-baby you know
My love is all you need
L-O-V-E-S-H-I-T
