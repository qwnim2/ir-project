Take over flipside when I'm stuck on the lies
Thought I meant more to you than just a read through
And so fast you start to re-open your heart
And 'cause we crashed I can do nothing

When it's over, it was over and you ran to another
It was easy, it was easy to replace me, to replace

So I don't need a back-up baby you were more than enough
I know you've got your back-up and you putting her in front
I don't need a back-up oh I get through it on my own
So go ahead with your back-up back-up, don't need a back-up back-up

Pain won't be too heavy I'll move on when I'm ready
And your temporary happy will have broken
'Cause nothing should start till you have healed your heart
You drew it in my stars too soon,

When it's ending, it was ending you were already pretending
Can't believe it, was so easy to replace me, to replace

'Cause I don't need a back-up baby you were more than enough
I know you've got your back-up and you putting her in front
I don't need a back-up oh I get through it on my own
So go ahead with your back-up back-up, don't need a back-up back-up
I don't need a back-up baby you were more than enough
I know you've got your back-up and you putting her in front
I don't need a back-up oh I get through it on my own
So go ahead with your back-up back-up, don't need a back-up back-up

When that glitch comes into the system, you'll have another girl on the go
I shoulda been wise had more than one drive but the truth this is going to blow, oh no
Better back it up back it up 'cause this boy can't be alone
Oh no
When you've given up given up I won't say ya told you so
