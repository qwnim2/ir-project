Wish you could take me away
Pretend that I am your baby
Somewhere faraway,somewhere in the shade
somewhere we can call our secret place
somewhere in the rain,somewhere we can play
somewhere we can be free and run away

Cause I really wanna take you away
Cause I wanna walk with you into space
and pick out the stars in the sky
and put them all on your face
Cause I won't let you change
Never change

One day I'll take you away
Kiss you and call you my baby
Somewhere in the sky

somewhere we can fly
somewhere where we don't need to run and hide
somewhere down below
somewhere in the snow
somewhere where the sun will shine all night

Cause I really wanna take you away
Cause I wanna walk with you into space
and pick out the stars in the sky
and put them all on your face
Cause I won't let you change
Never change

Cause I promise to give
you the rest of
my life
