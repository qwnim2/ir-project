You think that I'm your fool
Can't you see that you're so cruel
Didn't you tell me that you loved me
Didn't you say that I was all that you want

Why do you have to be so bad

Why do you have to be so bad
You always make me feel like a stupidhead

I'll think of loosing you

Cause I don't want to be confused
Didn't I give you all you wanted
Given you everything and you don't care

Why do you have to be so bad
Couldn't you try to be a better man
Why do you have to be so bad
Couldn't you try a little to understand
