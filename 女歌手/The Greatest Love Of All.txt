Written：Michael Masser/Linda Creed

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone to fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity
Chorus:
Because of greatest love of all is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all inside of me
The greatest love of all is easy to achieve

Learning to love yourself it is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride
To make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow
If I fail, if I succeed, at least I live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Chorus

And if by chance that special place
that you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love
