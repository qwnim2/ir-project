戀曲1990英文版
作詞：羅大佑
作曲：羅大佑

Baby,when I'm feeling blue
I keep thinking of you
Maybe one day you will see
My sweet dreams come true
When I call you on the phone
I get worried inside
Try so hard to tell the words
I'm longing to say

Whenever I meet you, girl
I don't know what to say
I just love the way you smile

that makes me feel fine
When I get so close to you

I can feel your heartbeat
How I love to see your eyes
Looking so shy

Everything is clear to see that
You are in love with me
Giving me a destiny that I can't reach
Being with a lady like you
I'll never ask for more
Give me something I can hold on
Til the end of time
