That I would be good even if I did nothing
That I would be good even if I got the thumbs down
That I would be good if I got and stayed sick
That I would be good even if I gained ten pounds

That I would be fine even if I went bankrupt
That I would be good if I lost my hair and my youth
That I would be great if I was no longer queen
That I would be grand if I was not all knowing

That I would be loved even when I numb myself
That I would be good even when I am overwhelmed
That I would be loved even when I was fuming
That I would be good even if I was clingy

That I would be good even if I lost sanity
That I would be good
Whether with or without you



[中譯]
就算一事無成，我會好好的；就算飽受噓聲，我會好好的
就算疾病纏身，我會好好的；就算重了十磅，我會好好的

就算身無分文，我會好好的；就算青春不再，我會好好的
就算不再受注目，我會很好的；就算並非全知，我會很好的

就算心已麻木，我還會有人愛；就算被世界擊倒，我會好好的
就算滿懷怒意，我還會有人愛；就算害怕寂寞，我會好好的
就算失去理智，我會好好的；我會好好的，無論有你沒你。
