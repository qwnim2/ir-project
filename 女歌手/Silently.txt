I'm missing you
I'm feeling blue
In the night

With starry skies
And starry eyes
Shining bright

Walking in your sleep
With love you come to me
Silently

＊Sliently you come away
　Won't you stay another day
　Silently you run away
　Forever and ever

　How silently you took my love away

I'll be waiting
I'll be praying
For the day
When you will learn
And will return
For always

Talking in your sleep
Of love you sing to me
Heavenly
Silently you come away
Won't you stay another day
Silently you run away
Forever and ever
How sliently you took my love away

Repeat ＊,＊
