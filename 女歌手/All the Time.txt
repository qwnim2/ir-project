(Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby)

If I had a bit more time
If I learned how to rewind
Maybe you wanna be mine
My love, my love

I don't know what's happening next
Maybe this love's about to confess
Won't you come on take off my dress
My love, my love

Wish I was there for you come to
Baby I'd be the one you need too
Maybe you could be my boo

I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
All the time, baby
I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
All the time

It's weird cos I don't need space
I just love to see your face
Cos in my heart you've got your place
My love, my love

Hunny you don't need to stress
I thank the Lord that we're so blessed
Thanks for coping with my mess
My love, my love, yeah

Ya know I'll be the one you come to
When the whole world turns and don't please you
I don't care cos I love you

I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
All the time, baby
I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
I really think about you all the time
All the time, baby

Oh baby
(Oh baby, oh baby)
