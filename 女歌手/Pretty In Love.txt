Lyrics：莫文蔚
Music：伊秩弘將

BABY PLEASE PLEASE I DON'T WANNA PLAY WITH ANOTHER
I'M PRETTY &amp; TOO MUCH IN LOVE
REMEMBER LONG LONG AGO
WE'D BE DANCING FOREVER AND FOREVER WAS NEVER ENOUGH.
(AND FOREVER TOGETHER IN LOVE)

IN ALL MY IMAGINATION YOU ARE A TRUE FANTASY
THINKING OF YOU COMES SO EASILY
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN MAKE ME FEEL HEAVENLY
WON'T YOU STAY A LITTLE LONGER PLEASE？

EVERY TIME YOU PASS ME BY
EVERY SPARKLE IN YOUR EYE
MY HEART STOPS BEATING FOR A WHILE
AND EVERY LITTLE THING I DO
I ONLY DO FOR YOU I CAN'T DENY THAT I LOVE YOU

JUST TRY TO IMAGING BEING WITH YOU IN PURE REVERIE
LOVING YOU MAKES LIVING SO EASY
I REMEMBER THE TIME WHEN WE WOULD KISS BREATHLESSLY
CAN WE LOVE LIKE HOW IT USED TO BE？
