I think it's time some things should change
It doesn't have to be that way
I think it's time some things should change
It doesn't have to be that way

You're the first on the list when numbers are glowing
And the last on their list at the end of your success
Cos' you should have known better
That it has always been that way, been that way
You remember the past

The slamming, the screaming of your parents
And so you stop believing in love
And you think it's okay but it doesn't have to be that way, be that way

I think it's time some things should change
It doesn't have to be that way
I think it's time some things should change
It doesn't have to be that way
