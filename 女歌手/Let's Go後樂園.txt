'Let It Go'粵語版
作詞：林夕
作曲：J.Levine/J.Mccollum

Yah, c'mon
You know, I've been thinking
What's up Elva
Well if you got something to say, then say it
Listen up, listen up

這一首歌真的不想講單戀
真的不想首首歌只講相戀　(That's true)
這一生中真的不只得苦戀
這一首歌很想講青春苦短
前在暗戀　後要眷戀
始終會構成傷損
忘掉正選　別要副選　Oh…
Oh…聯朋結黨找去路　女生都跳舞
Yeah…去跳舞那會說No
You gotta let it go

So let me get this straight
You're saying no strings attached,
no cash does it seem that for fetched
Nah, I think you're right
Ain't that love is overated
Some girls are really faded
They're always dedicated
Bot some guys are too

That's true

一生中當然少不得初戀　初戀當然終於只得到失戀
(Yah, more flavor)
失戀所損失的都不必貪戀　誰聽到快到後樂園遊一圈
離愁別恨太過土　賣弄友愛會更糟
講戀愛有甚麼好　寧願跳高　別要跳虱

Well let me tell you what I think,
I'll give you a piece of my mind
Cuz eveytime you lead me on, you make me stop on a dime
It's all good if you wanna flaunt it,
I wanna get up on it, but stop the tease
Just say please, if you really want it
We can take it fast or slow just don't say no
What are you all getting crazy for
It's either do or don't
It's eitehr will or won't
It's rather simple so cut the crap c'mon lets get it on.
But if its another one of those games
That you're playing and I happen to know
Then babe, I'm sorry, I'm gonna let you go
Let's go, yah, that's right
Let's go, yah, that's right
Let's go, yah, that's right
Let's go, yah, that's right
Let's go, yah, that's right
