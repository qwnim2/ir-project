You're gone

I can't believe it
I can't believe it

You're everything to me

I still feel you
I still feel you
After all this time even if I had forever

I never get over you

'Cause I still feel you by my side

And after all we've been through
still I never could say goodbye
I've tried a thousand times

but I can't walk away
I'll never let go
I'll never forget you

It's so hard to breathe
it's hard to breathe

Remember when the way it felt
when you held me
when you held me
After all this time everyday just takes forever

I'll never get over you

'Cause I still feel you by my side

And after all we've been through
still I never could say goodbye
I've tried a thousand times

but I can't walk away
I'll never let go

I'll never forget you

Every moment you're gone
feels like a million years
the memories won't fade away no
I'm missing everything about you
I can't escape this feeling
my love won't change
'Cause I still feel you by my side

And after all we've been through
still I never could say goodbye
I've tried a thousand times
but I can't walk away
I'll never let go

I'll never forget you

'Cause I still feel you by my side

And after all we've been through

still I never could say goodbye

I've tried a thousand times
but I can't walk away
I'll never let go

I'll never forget you

You're gone

I can't believe it

I can't believe it

You're gone
你不在了
I can't believe it
我無法相信
I can't believe it
我無法相信
