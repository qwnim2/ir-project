Hey...
I say Hey
What's going on
And I say hey
I say hey
What's going on

25 years of my life and still
I'm trying to get up that great big hill of hope
for a destination
I realized quickly when I knew I should
that the world was made up of this brotherhood of man
for whatever that means
So I cry sometimes when I'm lting on the bed
To get it all out what's in my head
Then I start feeling a little peculiar
So I wake in the morning and I step
outside I take a deep breath
I get real high
Then I scream from the top of my lungs

What's going on

And I say hey...etc.
And I said hey what's goin' on
And I say hey...etc.
I said hey what's goin' on

And I try, oh my God do I try
I try all the time
in this institution
And I pray, oh my God do I pray
I pray every single day
For a revolution
So I cry sometimes when I'm lying in bed
to get it all out what's in my head
Then I start feeling a little peculiar
So I wake in the morning and I step
outside I take a deep breath
I get real high
Then I scream from the top of my lungs
What's going on
