Every day is so wonderful
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe
Now and then, I get insecure
From all the pain, I'm so ashamed

I am beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring me down
I am beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring me down Oh no
So don't you bring me down today

To all your friends, you're delirious
So consumed in all your doom
Trying hard to fill the emptiness
The piece is gone left the puzzle undone
It that the way it is

You are beautiful no matter what they say
Words can't bring you down oh no
You are beautiful in every single way
Yes, word can't bring you own oh no
So don't you bring me down today...

No matter what we do
(no matter what we do)
No matter what we say
(no matter what we say)
We're the song inside the tune
Full of beautful mistakes
And everywhere we go
(and everywhere we go)
The sun will always shine
But tomorrow we might shine
On the other side

We are beautiful，no matter what they say
Yes, words won't bring us down oh no
We are beautiful in every single way
Yes, words can't bring us down oh no
So don't bring me down today...

Don't you bring me down...today...
Don't you bring me down...today
