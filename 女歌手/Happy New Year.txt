No more champagne.And the fireworks
Are through.Here we are
Me and you.Felling lost
And feeling blue.It's the end of the party
And the morning.Seems so grey
So unlike.Yesterday Now's the time
For us to say

Happy new year.Happy new year
May we all.Have a vision
Now and then.Of a world where
Every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year.Happy new year
May we all.Have our hopes
Our will to try.If we don't
We might as well.Lay down and die
You and I

World arrives.And I see
How it thrives.In the ashes
Of our lives.Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks.He'll be ok
Dragging on.Feet of clay
Never knowing.He's astray
Keeps on going.Anyway
Happy new year...

Seems to me now.That the dreams
We had before.Are all dead
Nothing more.Than confetti
On the floor.It's the end of the decade
In another ten year's time
Who can say.What we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of.Ninty-nine
Happy New Year...
