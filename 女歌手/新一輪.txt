Oh see you break your back and blend in what you want
A puppet on the strings drags himself into another run

Turning and returning to the ghost town
What're you hiding from
Haunted by the notion, make a motion
Come and get things done

Oh see you preen your feathers and blend in what you want
A puppet on the strings' reminding himself not to bloom

Turning and returning to the ghost town
What're you hiding from
Haunted by the notion, make a motion
Come and get things done
