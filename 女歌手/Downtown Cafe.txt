I saw her mother this morning
At the downtown cafe
Staring blankly
Down in mourning
Had her cup of gourmet coffee
And she asked me
What her baby'd been missing
And I shake my head
Can't think of nothing
But candy wrappers
Tucked into the folds of the bed
And how I don't see them around
Since Sarah left town

Now people always think they know you
And they're almost always wrong
Tried to bend you till they broke you
So she moved along
And sometimes I see them around
Since Sarah left town
Trying to track her down

Sarah, Sarah

Sarah, Sarah

She's chasing her soul
Not running away
If you'd just let her go
She'll know the way

And I saw her mother this morning
She looked me in the eye
She said: “you know sometimes,
                 I think I hear her laughing

        And all I can do is cry”
And it's a funny thing about people
How everyone has a song
And he sings it every moment
But we don't hear it until he's gone
And sometimes I see them around
Since Sarah left town
They're humming with heads hanging down

Sarah, Sarah
Sarah, Sarah
