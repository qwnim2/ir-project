Say what they want, I don't care what they say
別說太多 顯得心裡有鬼
I see the road and I'm still on my way
經驗跟教訓我自己繳費
Girls gon do what they want
Who said I can't do what I want

美的醜的 do what you want
沒得吵啊 say what you want
You see the walk
Don't like to talk
Gang related, affiliated
Stay sedated
Always debated
Reporters nag
Body bag

9 million dollars in my bank account
Walked out the door, burned the whole place down
現在起不想要客套
忙著賺錢 別再胡鬧
9 million dollars in my bank account
9 millimeter left you one last round
做自己 不想要客套
沒理想 也不算太糟
由我吹響號角

Sounds like the same shit, different day
你說了太多你心裡有鬼
付出的時間我多你一倍

Don't really matter, I still get my way
Girls gon do what they want
Who said I can't do what I want
沒的醜的 do what you want
Watch me, do it, do what I want
You see the walk
