I've been on the low lately
It's been hard to concentrate lately
Cos instead I've been thinking of you, of you, baby

Have I been on your mind
Is it hard to focus all of the time
Cos I've been wondering how are you, how are you

Can't have you, won't have you mess with my head, my head
I just want you here with me to smoke with me in my bed

Could this be forever
Would you be my forever
Don't worry, you'll forget her
We look so cute together

Look so cute together
So cute together

Do you need me like I need you
When you ready, when you really need to
Cos I'll be waiting on you, on you, baby

Give you time to think about it
But don't be a little bitch about it
Cos I got my feelings too

Can't have you, won't have you fuck with my mind, my mind
Can't you just be the one, the only one all the time

Can this be forever
Would you be my forever
Don't worry, you'll forget her
We look so cute together
Look so cute together
So cute together

Where do we belong in the galaxy
Would be really nice if you'd float with me
Fell in love with you accidentally, accidentally
Where do we belong in the galaxy
Would be really nice if you'd float with me
Fell in love with you accidentally, accidentally

Look so cute together
Look so cute together
