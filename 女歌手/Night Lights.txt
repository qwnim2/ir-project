I've got this song in my heart and I can't deny it
The way you look tonight
Grips my heart got me groovin'
Oh baby, baby please stay the night
Don't ever, ever let me be out of your sight
It gets a little colder
When you're not here with me
I need your warm lovin', tender kisses
Embrace me
So darling let's make our time last
Forget about what's behind
What's in the past

In every part of me
My, my
Oh, can't you see that you're so beautiful to me
Oh, can't nobody control my greed
Just hold me a little bit closer, a little tighter
Put your lips on mine and we'll be oh so fine
Oh baby, please give me a sign
Oh, don't you know it's true that I'm fallin' for you and
