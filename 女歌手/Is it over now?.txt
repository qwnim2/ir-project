'手'DEMO
原唱：莫文蔚

is it over now
do we really have to say goodbye
does it mean that we can't talk anymore
cos I still love you so
cos I didn't mean to break your heart
if only you knew why I had to let you go

is it over now
feels like it's the end of the world
I don't really wanna try to get over you
cos I still see your face
feel your breath everywhere I go
don't think I'll ever find someone just like you

I thought we could last
be together forever
but we didn't last
we sure did put up a fight
now it hurts so bad
with you out of my life
is it really over now

Guess it's over now
cos I'm sitting here all alone
someone is knocking but it won't be you at my door
letting go is never easy
I've been learning in the hard way
I've been counting every minute and second
since the day you left
