Summertime and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
oh your Daddy's rich and your ma is good lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry

One of there morning
You're goin' to rise up singing
And you'll spread your wings
And you'll take to the sky
But till that morning
There's no one can harm you baby
Oh (with your) daddy and mammy standin' by

Summertime
Summertime
