I can tell by your eyes
That you're probably being crying forever
And the stars in the sky
Don't mean nothing to you they are mirrors

I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart

If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here won't you listen
To my heart oh my heart

If I stand all alone will be shadow
Hide the colors of my heart
(Blue for the tears black for the nights)
Still the stars in the sky
Don't mean nothing to you they are mirrors
