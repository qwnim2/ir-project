Lyrics：莫文蔚
Music：伊秩弘將(Hiromasa Ijichi)

Pretty Baby Oh Pretty Baby
What's come over ? You look weary today.
Kinda weary Like a child at play
I see no reason for regrets or dismay

What I say I never ever say it in an ordinary fishion
What I do I do with total passion
Listen to my cries Look into my eyes

Lucky lady Oh lucky lady
I have a feeling of success on the way

Never easy On a rainy day
I take no comfort in the games that you play

I say I'll play I'll lay down my rules before you turn away
and I swear I dare To share all my love
if only you would do as I say

Lovely lady Oh lovely lady
What is the secret to success all the way
A little beauty Goes a long long way
it conjures up the little trick that I play
