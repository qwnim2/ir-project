I'm on top of the world,
I feel like a satellite,I feel like a satellite
and I,m on top of the world,
I feel like a satellite,I feel like a satellite

I think I will sing a song tonight,
don't care how it sound, it feels alright.

T minus 10,9,8,
I got a spaceship , we should fly away tonight,
let's kick it on the moon and sip Kool-Aid,
no need for money cause the bills get paid themselves.

It's like
I'm on top of the world,
I feel like a satellite,I feel like a satellite
and I,m on top of the world,
I feel like a satellite,I feel like a satellite

Take about dreams come true, me and you , how's the view?
(I feel like a satellite)

Write me a message in the stars,
we got the milky way,
so, we don't need no trains , no cars.

T minus 10,9,8,

Jump in my rocket it's just you and me and the sky,
float on a shooting star and hold me tight,
we'll pop some skittles cause we don't need drugs to get high.
