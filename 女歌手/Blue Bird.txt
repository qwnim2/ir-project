Let me take you somewhere, where the bluebirds sing
Let me take you a party, where the DJ's playing our song
待到太陽升起 我們也不在意
Let's go somewhere with coconut trees
6 in the morning 原來是你簡訊

What a life it could be if you could run away with me
And I don't give a damn 我也無所謂
What the hell you think these haters gonna say
Gotta turn it up

If you're really willing to be
Just a little closer to me
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down
If you're really willing to be
And you're not about the money
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down

帶我去個地方 不存在哭泣
帶我去個地方 微笑不用刻意
不用耍心機 什麼都可以
帶我去走走如果你願意

把行李揹起 不用管天氣
Gotta turn it up

If you're really willing to be
Just a little closer to me
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down
If you're really willing to be
And you're not about the money
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down

If you're really willing to be
Just a little closer to me
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down
If you're really willing to be
And you're not about the money
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down

If you're really willing to be
And you're not about the money
Maybe we can get down
Maybe we can get down
