什麼都 ok
什麼都完美
世界的煩惱
全部都忘掉
你身邊有人陪
You're having a nice day
Umbrellas in my drink and all

沒有需要改變什麼
有其他的 I'm no other
我就像你每天望著
昨天走了 明天來了

Put on an old song
Just like old times
With your old man, rock on

Hey pops, the future is here
And everybody's singing to our song
Put on an old song
Just like old times
With your old man, c'mon
Hey pops, tomorrow is here and everybody's singing along

Put on an old song
Just like old times
With your old man, rock on

Hey pops, the future is here
And everybody's singing to our song
Put on an old song
Just like old times
With your old man, c'mon
Hey pops, tomorrow is here and everybody's singing along

Chill on the stars tonight
Let's go chill on the stars tonight

Let's boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, c'mon
Let's boogie
Boogie, boogie
Boogie, boogie, c'mon

Put on an old song
Just like old times
With your old man, rock on

Hey pops, the future is here
And everybody's singing to our song
Put on an old song
Just like old times
With your old man, c'mon
Hey pops, tomorrow is here and everybody's singing along
