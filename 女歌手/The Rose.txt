Lyrics：Amanda Mcbroom
Music：Amanda Mcbroom

Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring
becomes the rose
Some say love it is a river that drowns the tender reed
Some say love it is a razor that leaves your soul to bleed
Some say love it is a hunger an endless aching need
I say love it is a flower and you it's only seed
It's the heart afraid of breaking that never learns to dance
It's the dream afraid of waking that never takes the chance
It's the one who won't be taken who cannot seem to give
And the soul afraid of dying that never learns to live
When the night has been too lonely
And the road has been too long
And you think that love is only for the lucky and the strong

Just remember in the winter for beneath the bitter snow
Lies the seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose

(Rap)
Life is a gift and you gotta learn to live it if you believe in love
you gotta learn to give it
Tryin' to find someone who's kind is hard to do
You want the love but you really don't know what to do
You're just afraid of someone breaking your heart
You never learned to live you gave up from the start
You felt the pain but it made you strong
So remember no matter what you will go on



[中譯]
一粒深埋的種子,等待春天的陽光,即將變成一朵玫瑰
有人說愛是一條河,它會淹沒溫柔的蘆草　有人說,
愛是一把刀,它教人心靈泣血　有人說,愛是飢渴, 一個永遠痛苦的需求
而我說,愛是一朵花,一朵只會根植你心的花　一個害怕破碎的心,
不可能學會跳舞　一個害怕清醒的夢,不可能把握機會
一個不願付出的人,他大概不會給予　而一個害怕死亡的靈魂,
是不可能學會生命的真諦　當夜晚太孤寂,當道路太漫長,
而你以為愛只是給那幸運且堅強的人們　只要記得,
在冬天的冰雪深埋著一粒種子,等待春天的陽光,即將變為一朵玫瑰
(RAP)生命是一個禮物,你必須學會掌握　若你相信愛,你必須學會付出
尋覓可愛的人,是困難的　你想要愛,但實在不知道怎麼做
你就是害怕別人使你傷心　你一開始就放棄怎能學會生命的真諦
你感到痛苦,但它讓你堅強　所以記得無論如何不要放棄
