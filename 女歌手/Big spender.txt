The minute you walked in the joint I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender, good looking, so refined say, wouldn't you like to know
What's goin on in my mind
so let me get right to the point I don't pop My cork for every man I see
hey, big spender, spend a little time with me

Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun how's bout few laughs, laughs
I could show you a good time let me show you a good time
