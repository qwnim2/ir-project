With I had a colour TV set.I'd sit around all day
And kick my shoes of anywhere
What is it about those pretty boys？
I wish they'd come alive.And bring some colour to my room
La la la ....Wish I had a colour TV set
I'd sit around all day.And let the day turn into night
Funny people playing up today
What a joke it is.For them to see me from their screen

La la la ....I wake in the morning
Just to see the sun！Looked out the window
to see people passing by.But nothing! just nothing
I think about the things to do
I think about my colourful sweet baby！！
Wish I had a colour TV set.Stay up late at night
Don't care what happens there and them
I'm sick of people knocking at the door
Just me my TV set.Will stick together through the times
La la la ....
