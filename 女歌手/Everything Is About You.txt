Had enough of hanging around
There must be something else to do
You can't seem to stop whining about
How life's been so unfair to you

Oh baby baby I'm I'm love
But not with you with someone else
You're maybe maybe unconcerned
Cos' everything's bout you (everything is about you)

Understand it's me not you
It's me who can't seem to be true
Can't go on, living in a lie
You didn't live up to expectations

Since the day you've entered my house
She become so old and weary
Wrinkled all my sheets and my face
There are just among the other thing

Oh enough enough of hanging around
There must be something else to do
No, this can't go on, this can't be allowed
I'm not a slave to you condescension

Du du du......
there are just among other things
