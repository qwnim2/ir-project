作詞：Dolly Parton
作曲：Dolly Parton

If I should stay
I'll only be in your way
So I ll go But I ll know
I ll think of you
every step of the way

And I will always love you
I will always love you

bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So goodbye Please don「t cry
We both know I'm not what you need

And I will always love you

I will always love you

I will always love you
I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you dreamed of
And I wish you joy and happiness
But above all this wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
