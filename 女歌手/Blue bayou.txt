I feel so bad I got a worried mind　I'm so lonesome all the time
Since I left my baby behind on blue bayou
Saving nickels, Saving dimes working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward To happier times on blue bayou

I'm going back some day come What may to blue bayou
Where the folks are fine and world is Mine on blue bayou
Where those fishing boats with their sails Float lf I could only see
That familiar sunrise through sleepy Eyes how happy I'll be

gonna see my baby again gonna be With some of my friends
maybe I'll feel better again on blue bayou
Saving nickels, saving dimes working til the sun don't shine
Looking forward to happier times on blue bayou

oh, that boy Of mine by my side the silver moon and the evening tide
Oh, some sweet day going to take away this hurting inside
Well, I'll never be blue my dreams come true on blue bayou
