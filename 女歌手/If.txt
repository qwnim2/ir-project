if life is a drama you cry on my shoulder
all the stars will shine and time has come

if something had happened
and time can be frozen
all the questions will be seen as one


if you are the sailor
but the ship wasn't there

could you sail to moon and catch the sun

if there is a difference
in between love and silence
could you tell me where it all begun


if you're child
i'll take you home

if there's a way
to find your soul

if you're a liar
i hope you know
you're not alone
