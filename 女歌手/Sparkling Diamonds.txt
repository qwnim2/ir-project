The French are glad to die for love ....

A kiss on the hand may be quite Continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand But it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat Or help you at the automat
Men grow cold As girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
But square-cut or pear-shaped
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

Tiffany's. . .
Cartier. . .

Cause we are living in a material world and I am a material girl
Come and get me boys!!
Black frost. . .
Pearl 'bossed. . .

Talk to me, Harry Sidler, tell me all about it!
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
There may come a time when a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice
But get that ice Or else no dice

He's your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best
Diamonds are a girl's best friend

'Cos that's when those louses
Go back to their spouses
Diamonds. . . Are a girl's best. . . friend
