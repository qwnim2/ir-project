Goddess on the mountain top
Burning like a siliver flame
The summit of beauty and love
And Venus was her name

She's got it?Yeah, baby, she's got it
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire
At your desire

Her weapons were her crystal eyes
Making every man a man
Black as the dark night she was
Got what no-one else had
Wa!

She's got it?Yeah, baby, she's got it

[中譯]

山頂上的女神閃爍如銀亮的火焰
絕頂美貌與無上的愛情
維納斯是她的名　她有魔力
Yeah 寶貝她有魔力~~

我是你的維納斯
我能點燃你的愛火
滿足你的無限渴望

我是你的維納斯
我能點燃你的愛火
滿足你的無限渴望

提防她水晶般的雙眼
足夠讓每個男人瘋狂
如黑夜般邪氣　她的魔力無人擁有 Wa
