Lyrics：范曉萱
Music：范曉萱

Why don't you say that you love me
Why don't you say that you care
I can be your's You can be mine
We can go the heaven together

* Why don't you say that you fear me
Why don't you say that you don't
I can be nine You can be cruel
We can play good till from now till forever

Why can't you say it? Why oh why
