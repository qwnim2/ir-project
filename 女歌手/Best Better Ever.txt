Hey girl don't lose your mind
You will be fine
After the drowsy night
They say that love is blind
He leads you to the left, but it can't be right, alright?

All the passing people
After all they come and go
What they talk and what they do
I don't even have a clue
If you wanna be adored
Wake up, make up, and dress up
Nothing to do with cheering them up
Hold to the core of cosmo

ah~ ah~
I've been aching, I'm in danger, just save me from drowning in
You~ ou~
No matter what they judge you by, hold to the core of cosmo

踏著閃耀星辰鋪開的路
我昂首闊步
我聽說路的盡頭有一扇門
裡面是更健康、潔淨的生活
有更好的水和更美麗的波紋
我於是昂首闊步

途中也猶豫過
害怕更好的未必更好
但是腳下的星辰閃耀啊
所以我還是昂首闊步

我最終抵達終點
推開那扇門
我發現
裡面所有的人
都是我

I'll make you satisfy
No sacrifice
You can keep all the pride
As long as you're by my side
Everything can be bright, like a diamond shine and shine

All the passing people
After all they come and go
What they talk and what they do
I don't even have a clue
If you wanna be adored
Wake up, make up, and dress up
Nothing to do with cheering them up
Hold to the core of cosmo

ah~ ah~
I've been aching, I'm in danger, just save me from drowning in
You~ ou~
No matter what they judge you by, hold to the core of cosmo

ah~ ah~
I've been aching, I'm in danger, just save me from drowning in
You~ ou~
No matter what they judge you by, hold to the core of cosmo
