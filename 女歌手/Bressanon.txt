Here I stand in Bressanone
With the stars up in the sky
Are they shining over Brenner
And upon the other side

You would be a sweet surrender
I must go the other way
And my train will carry me onward
Though my heart would surely stay
Wo my heart would surely stay

Now the clouds are flying by me
And the moon is on the rise

I have left stars behind me
They were disamondsin your skies

You would be a sweet surrender
I must go the other way
And my train will carry me onward
Though my heart would surely stay
Wo my heart would surely stay

Here I stand in Bressanone
With the stars up in the sky
Are they shining over Brenner
Though my heart would surely stay
Wo my heart would surely stay
