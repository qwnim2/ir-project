Got a funny feeling
Just how long you been creepin'
別以為我不會揭穿
你和她的爛演技 有多難堪

I'll always be the one to call
Always be the one to fall
But oh babe 請借過
想要我 下輩子再來過 再來過

沒有你 眼淚不再掉了
沒有你 我們更加快樂
Baby can't you hear me
I don't need nobody

Better luck
Catching your next hoe
Better not
Think you're getting too close
假裝你還 need me, need me
I don't need nobody

Better luck
Next time now we're through
Spilling lies
Boy you know the truth
管你真的 need me, need me
I don't need your body

To the left, to the left
I don't need no
I don't need
I don't need your body

感覺有點詭異
像在逢場作戲
Don't think I never realized
Caught up in your fantasies with her and I

有需要才想打給我
我不是你的玩偶
But oh babe here's the door
To the left, you're shit on the floor, on the floor

沒有你 眼淚不再掉了
沒有你 我們更加快樂
Baby can't you hear me
I don't need nobody

Better luck
Catching your next hoe
Better not
Think you're getting too close
假裝你還 need me, need me
I don't need nobody

Better luck
Next time now we're through
Spilling lies
Boy you know the truth
管你真的 need me, need me
I don't need your body

I don't need no
Better luck next time yeah
Better luck next time yeah

I don't need your body
