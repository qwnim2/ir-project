'好想放假'原曲

Today it's gonna be okay
Cos the fortune teller said so
So I think it's safe to go out
Put on my finest pair of shades
Pack my bags I'll
Go west to the seaside

Who cares if it's gonna rain or shine
Cos the fortune teller said so
So there's nothing else that could go wrong
So what, if no one even cares
Pack my bads I'll
Go up the mountains

Da da da ...
If you feel the same as I do

Come with me

Maybe I'm just a little scared
Neurotic, paranoid's my name
Everyone has their own reasons
Feeling a little insecure
Guess I'll need a break
Or change of seasons

Maybe it's gonna be okay
Cos for so long I've felt so down
Everything just had to go wrong
Till now, the fortune teller siad
That from now on it's luck
That will come my way
