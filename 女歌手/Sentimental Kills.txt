EVERYTIME WHEN I FELL ASLEEP
I WISH I WON'T PRETEND TO SLEEP.

OH-NO, MAYBE I AM A FREAK.

EVERYTIME WHEN I SHED A TEAR
HOW I WISH I WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE YOU SORRY.

BUT THE LAZY DAYS LIE ON MY BED.

THE STORY GOES ON, YEARS GO BY
THE SHADOW TELLS ME,
SENTIMENTAL KILLS.

EVERYTIME WHEN I FELL ASLEEP
I WISH I REALLY HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DREAM.
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

PLEASE, SAVE SAVE SAVE ME.
