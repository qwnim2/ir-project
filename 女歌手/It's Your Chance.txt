王菲'打錯了'原曲英文版
Lyrics：Tanya Chua
Music：Tanya Chua
Arranger：Kenn C

Have you thought it over ?
Have you gotten what you deserve
Was it off your shoulder
Were you relieved to know that everything worked out ?

Have you gotten over
Have you started a brand new life
Have you met somebody
Someone who's ordinary
Someone unlike me

C:
'Cos now it's your chance
To do what you wanna do
There's no time to waste
The day is still young
The world waits for no one
What are you waiting for ?

To do what you wanna do
There's no time to waste
The day is still young
The world waits for no one
What are you waiting for ?
