Drunk on my sobriety
Driven by your insanity
Made to stumble in my formative years
Could've sworn it was my perversion
Care to spare me a minute？
Could i be alone for awhile
Fortunately you were out of my way
Could've sworn it was my possession
Until next time
Until next life
Never knew you'd hurt me
Now you crave for sincerity
Thought we'd be around for twenty long years

So it's just imagination
Was it bad now really？
When the sex has lost all its charm
Who's to blame for putting up with the fight
So it's just to my elation
Until next time
Until next life
I'll wear my clothes right
I'll sleep on the other side
I'll say what's necessary
Until next time....
