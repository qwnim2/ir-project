原曲：Let It Go
Music：Jason Levine/James Mccollum

Yah, C'mon
You know I've been thinking﹝What's up, Elva﹞
Well﹝If you got somethind to say, then say it﹞
Listen up, Listen up

If you want me there is something you should know
I'm the type of girl who will not be controlled﹝That's true﹞
Do not fall over me wherever I go
And if you hurt inside I'm not responsible

Why do boys get crazy like the world is gonna end today
Give it time or give it up

Oh wow if you want to get with me
You're got to let it go
Yeah yeah If you want to get with me
You're got to let it go

So let me get this straight,
you're saying no strings atached no catch
﹝Does it seem that for fetched﹞
Nah, I think you're right I Think that love is overvated
some girls are really faded, they're way to dedicated
﹝but some guys are too﹞That's true

Everytime you try to talk to me it's clear
You're just saying things you think I want to hear
Promise you won't give up on me tomorrow
And you will be to we my forever

Boy will search stop anything they can sti who stop their way
Are will no be fooled this time

Oh wow if you want to get with me
You're got to let it go
Yeah yeah If you want to get with me
You're got to let it go

Well let me tell you what I think,
I'll give you a piece of my mind
Cuz everytime you lead me on
You make me stop on a dime
It's all good if you wanna flaunt it
I wanna get up on it

But stop the tease
Just say please if you really want it
Cuz we can take it fast or slow just don't say no
What are you all getting crazy for
It's either do or don't It's either will or won't
It's rather simple so cuz the crap c'mon lets get it on
But if it's another one of those games that you're playing
And I happen to know Then Babe
I'm sorry I'm gonna have to let you go

Why do boys get crazy like the world is gonna end today
Give it time or give it up

Oh wow if you want to get with me
You're got to let it go
Yeah yeah If you want to get with me
You're got to let it go

But there's players out there whon don't care
If I get hurt of not cuz I know what's up
I'm all about feeling wanna know with who I'm dealing
I had enough I need a men that sends me reeling
