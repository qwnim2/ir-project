I thought I heard my name
As I walked along the streets I felt strange
Somebody's watchin my face
And now my life will never be the same

Am I somebody changed?
Cause without no makeup on I feel shame
No you can't smoke or swear
Now my life will never be the same

Could these be the wicked signs
Of tryin be a superstar
Could these be the wicked signs
Would you like an autograph of mine?

Everyday starving myself
Cos I gotta be a prefect size 8
Try beat a pimple race
Now my life will never be the same

I thought I heard my name
As I walked along the streets I felt strange
Somebody's watchin my face
And now my life will never be the same?

Ba da da......My life will never be the same
Ba da da......My life will never be the same
