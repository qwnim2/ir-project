(Santa Claus is Coming to Town)

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
ring-ting tingling too
Come on it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
and comfy cose are we
We're snuggled up together

like birds of a feather would be
Outside the snow is falling and
friends are calling you
Come on it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take the road deep forest and
sing a chorus or two
Come on it's lovely weather
for a sleigh ride together with you
