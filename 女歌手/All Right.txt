(前身是'好無聊')

I'm frightened by the thought of hanging around too much on my own
That's when the demons come and play on my ground of thoughts
Something's wrong with me yet I can't figure it out by myself
When will it be all right?

Time passes by so slowly when you cannot sleep at night
When someone right comes along you let him slip away
The streets are filled with sirens chasing down the violence
Damn ! When will it be all right?

No it doesn't get better
When people fake it saying they understand
What to them doesn't matter
How I ever got to feeling so low

I can't recall much happy moments in my childhood years

When someone laughs at me I'm nowhere to run and hide
Constantly seeking ways to make a point but no one hears
When will I be all right?

Don't you start making compromises
It wouldn't be of any use to me now
Don't you start maling up for time
Because it wouldn't be all right

I'm frightened but the thought of hanging around too much on my own
That's when the demons come and play on my ground of thoughts
Something's wrong with me yet I ca'mt figure it out all by myself
When will it be all right?
Damn! When will it be all right?
Damn! When will it be all right?
