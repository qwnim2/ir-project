Lyrics：林夕
Music：Tanya Chua

Here I am. wrecking my brains
Smoking my cigarette and don't know
How to get it right
You came and told me that life is not
Just about chocolates
Mister man. are you insane？
Who do you think you are
To jump in too
You must me blind！
I'm all deliverance you gotta set them free
From their answers
So how do we see？
Should we take a little minute

Just to sing a song？
So how should we be？
Find a way or fade away？
Little Sam. when you became
A pretty boy without a face of make-up on
We're so beguiled
You act as if the world needs a face
And that yours be'd the bearer
Here I am, wrecking my brains
Smoking my cigarettes and don't know
How to get it right
You came and told me that life is not
Just about chocolates
