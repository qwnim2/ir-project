You were so dark when we met
Now you're as light as my deathbed
And though you speak like a fiend
You just sing like an angel

I'm not longing to hold
I'm not craving to touch you
I'm just blissful to be
In the same space that you're in

I don't know why my grace is leaving
I don't know what your face is meaning
Often enough I bore your aching

Hoping to learn that you were faking
I don't know why my trace is leaving
I don't know what your face is meaning
Often enough you bore my sorrow
Hoping to catch a tear to borrow

I will be heading for your rocks
And trying to melt down the hardness of your soul
Of your soul

I was so light when we met
Now I'm as dark as your deathbed
And I will never be
In the same space that you're in
