作詞：張懸

戲劇散場我回家
公車站牌很遠 很難到達
握著票根還想著主角說的話

憂鬱很短 嘆息很長
其實有很多想法只是不被表達
我這會兒該擔心的是；媽媽
現在已快要十二點啦

以為生命就得如此地過去
卻難釋懷自己，需要跳得更強烈的心

So why do you worry me?
And why, don't you go to sleep
Aren't you confident that, everyone
Is Okay in the city

Why,Do you worry me?
And why don't you go to sleep
I thought I am but simple,
So simple to dream

日子該是不同形狀
堅持夢想不容易；人要努力
可是他說 這種事情遲早得放棄

以為沒有能輕鬆評斷對錯的真理
我不能釋懷自己那顆跳得夠強烈的心

But why don't you worry me?
Or why do you go to sleep?
Aren't you just with me that
This little child is okay for her searching

Why don't you worry me
And why do you go to sleep
I thought I am but simple,
So simple to dream

Why do you worry me?
Why don't you go to sleep
Aren't you confident that, everyone
Is Okay in the city

Why do you worry me?
Why don't you go to sleep
I thought I am but simple,
So simple to dream

I thought I am but simple,
So simple to dream
