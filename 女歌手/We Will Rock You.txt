Buddy you're a boy
Make a big noise playin' in the street
Gonna be a big man some day
You got blood on your face, big disgrace
Kicking your can all over the place

singing We will, we will rock you (ha ha)
We will, we will rock you

Keep the beat up, why, I'm gonna turn your heat up
Gonna get you on the floor, gonna turn your feet up
Rockin' you, like I never rocked you before
Like the way I do, got you screamin' for more

We're causin' utter devastation
When we steppin' to the place
You better believe that you can see
We're gonna rock and never stop
And here we go again
Hit you with the flow again

Kick it up the second time around
we'll bring it on again - shout it up

We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you
We will, we will rock you

Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Buddy you're an old man, poor man,
Pleading With you're eyes
Gonna make you something some day
You got mud on your face, big disgrace
Somebody better put you back in your place

singing We will, we will rock you (ha ha)
We will, we will rock you (x10)
