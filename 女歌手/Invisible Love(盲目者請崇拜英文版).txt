We never have a kiss in a crowd
or walk along the street holding hands
We haven't gone out just the two of us
Don't even have a photo together

Every time that I think about you
There is something shining in the air
It's just too bad that nobody can see
Only I know that it is real

Invisible love love love
It doesn't really matter
If only you can feel it
Invisible love love love
If only I can find myself in your eyes

I always go to the movies alone
It seems I never give you a call
There is not a trace of you, my baby
Anywhere in my room

Every time that I think about you
There is something shining in the air
It's just too bad that nobody can see
Only I know that it is real

Invisible love love love
It doesn't really matter
If only you can feel it
Invisible love love love
If only I can find myself in your eyes

Every time that I think about you
