You better watch out
You beter not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
He's checking it twice

He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice

He see's when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

With little horns and little toy drums
Rooty toot toots and rummy turn turns
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants boats and kiddie cars too
