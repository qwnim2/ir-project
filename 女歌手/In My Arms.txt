How do you describe a feeling?
I've only ever dreamt of this

DJ's spinning up my favorite song
hurry up and get a grove on
Light fantastic and it wont be long
don't let the moment slip away

Cause you and I could find a pleasure
no one else has ever known
Feels like it is now or never
don't want to be alone

How do you describe a feeling?

How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me
How does it feel in my arms?

I've only ever dreamt of this

Got a feeling this is something strong
All I wanna do is move on
No more wondering where I belong
So never go away

Cause you and I are guilty pleasure

How do you describe a feeling?

How does it feel in my arms?

How does it feel in my arms?
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me
How does it feel in my arms?

Do-do-do-do-do (＊3)
Oh yeah yeah
Do-do-do-do-do (＊3)
Oh yeah yeah

I'm listening
How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
How does it feel in my arms?
Yeah, Yeah
Do you want it? Do you need it?
Can you feel it? Tell me
How does it feel in my arms?
