I looked around for life.For something to hold me back in time
Yearning, waiting to.Break into the silence of the night
A thousand troubled lies.Trapped within truth and confusion
Forgive me.Maybe for the words I chose to say
If I should fall.Into your arms
Would I feel insecure？I'm so far away.But too close so you say
Funny why we make peace and love
Once again there's nothing to feel...
I'm sheltered from the light
Hiding behind this shady vision
Holding the wind

I hate to think that you won't be there anymore

I'm in love with you in every waking hour
Every now and then you move me
I'm in love with you in every waking hour
All the ashes in my eyes.
Don't you know that I love you I love you
And I want to.So if you are thinking of running away
Let me run with you
