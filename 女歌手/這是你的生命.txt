I don't know why I am getting a Green Card ?
所以你就不想去？
So you don't want to go ?
那好，這是你的決定，我們就不去
Ok, that's your decision, we won't go.

我尊重你的決定，不是江偉的

I respect your decision but not Giang Wei's.
如果你不想去，我們就不要去
So if you don't want to go, we won't go.
你也該在這時候學一學
And maybe it's time for you to also learn
多尊重你自己
to respect yourself a little more.
這是你的生命
It's your life.
