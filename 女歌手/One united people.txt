Lyrics：Joahun Wan
Music：Joahun Wan

One Singapore
One people strong &amp; free
With one heart, One voice we make our history
We are a rainbow of a thousand colors
lighting up the sky
we share the Singapore heartbeat together you &amp; I
We are

One Singapore
One nation strong &amp; free
A thousand different voices sing in harmony
We will stand together
together hand in hand as
One united people
for Singapore my homeland

My Singapore
Our island in the sun
this is my homeland
