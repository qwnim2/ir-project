All the girl, wish to be sexy

Pretty red dresses &amp; high heels

Put lip stick on and make me high

How gorgeous I am

I really love myself

Let's just be super cute girls

I don't need expensive things

You want me but you can't have it

lady come on join the party 'Dance Dance'

Show me how you're 'Moving'

they have a crush on you

Baby you're enslaved by my charm 'No No'

I don't mind 'Ah Ah'

#Nobody can stop me

Most of the girls wanna have fun

Going to clubs in the night time

My mom was always angry at me

But when she was young, she was hot

I really love myself

Let's just be super cute girls

I don't need expensive things

You want me but you can't have it

They give me diamond ring 'Bling Bling'

But they're nothing 'To Me'

Cause I'm much much more

Yes, you can't buy me 'No No'

Different from'The Others'

Nobody can stop me
