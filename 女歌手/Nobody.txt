原曲：沒有人
Love shatters a lonely heart
Up in the open sky
I see your face in the dark
Oh my love far from the earth
Where you're holding me close
Baby I, I love you so

Love dreams and illusions
I see in your eyes
Losing myself in your lies
I'm alone walking back home on my own
Lost and cold,
Can't find you anymore

Thears flowed they've gone cold

Crying in my sorrow
And no matter how I try and I try to
Remember where you used to be
I search my heart and I find there's no one there

Woh midnight I feel like I've died in my sleep
At light everything slie is mimi to me
Looking back on those wonderful moments
I had never dreamed this would be
Now all that's left is a broken heart with me

No one has ever been a dreamer for me
I've been a fool for loving you endlessly
