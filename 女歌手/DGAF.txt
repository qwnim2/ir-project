Saturday night and I'm all alone
Waiting for you to pick up your phone
(Please pick up baby, please pick up your phone, your phone)
Miss those nights, singing in the car
Now I'm just singing with a broken heart
(Broke my heart baby, broke my heart, yeah
Broke my heart baby, broke my heart, yeah)

I just want you, I just want you
To forget everything I said
Can't believe it, still can't see it
It gets a little crazy in my head

Feeling blue, without you
Miss it when it was just us two
Without you, I'm such a fool
Don't give a fuck, I just want you

Baby it's so cold outside
Shut up and just spend the night
You're on my heart, like a tattoo
Just come around, baby swing right thru

C'mon, just swing right thru, baby just swing right thru
C'mon, just swing right thru, baby just swing right thru
C'mon, just swing right thru, baby just swing right thru
Oh, just me and you, oh, just us two

It's 4am, and I'm feeling low
All I want is for you to come back home
(Please come home baby, please come home, yeah
Please come home baby, please come home, yeah)
I'm in my bed and it's really cold
Will you be the one I have to hold
(Be the one to have the hold, yeah
Be the one to have the hold, yeah)

I just want you, I just want you
To forget everything I said
(Everything I said)
Can't believe it, still can't see it
It gets a little crazy in my head
(Crazy in my head)

Feeling blue, without you
Miss it when it was just us two
Without you, I'm such a fool
Don't give a fuck, I just want you

Baby it's so cold outside
Shut up and just spend the night
You're on my heart, like a tattoo
Just come around, baby swing right thru

C'mon, just swing right thru, baby just swing right thru
C'mon, just swing right thru, baby just swing right thru
C'mon, just swing right thru, baby just swing right thru
Oh, just me and you, oh, just us two
