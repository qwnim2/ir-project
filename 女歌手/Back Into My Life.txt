It's been more than a year
But feels more like forever
You are still on my mind
You're still one of a kind
That no other men can replace
Oh you're so much more than them
They've all become just friends
They just don't understand
The way you understand
But now you're gone cos I've treated you wrong
Now I'm thinking
Every other ways for me to get you
Get you back into my life
But I don't know where you are
I don't know where to start
You could be very far
Or you could just live nearby
So for now I'm
Looking up my dictionary trying
To find some unordinary words

To say baby I'm sorry
Could you please forgive me
Oh baby
Won't you please come back into my life
Life's never been the same
I've learnt it the hard way
They say no pain no gain
But I've gained nothing but pain
I know you're gone
But I still can't move on
It's killing me to think that you might be in
Be in some other girl's arms
I don't know if I can
Take it like a man
I don't think that I can
Walk away or just pretend
Can't believe
That your girl's not me
That your girl's not me
Oh baby won't you please come back into my life
