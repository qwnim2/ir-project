Lyrics：Irving Berlin
Music：Irving Berlin

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the trees tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmas be write
