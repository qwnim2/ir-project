All the sadness in the air
How did we get to this?
Why did we end this way?
All the things we used to share
You said put them all away
Close my eyes they're still there yeah
Still trying to understand
Trying the best I can
To start over again oh

Chorus:
If who I am brings you not joy but tears babe
I cannot bear to see you fighting with this pain

So I wish you all the best
If we can't be lovers
Maybe we can still be friends

Though we never really knew
Why did our worlds collide
There were no reasons why
When we're meant to say goodbye
You were never really mine
You were just a state of mind
Still trying to understand
Trying the best I can
To start over again oh
