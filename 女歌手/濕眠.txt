Feels like dreaming
Feels like floating
I've been wondering when you'll come around

I've been thinking about you lately
Baby, won't you stay away this time
Oh

Boy I need you here, I need you by my side
過去那些場景無法再期待
沒你 我的生活只剩空白

It's getting late now
Time my turn off all the lights now
I've been wondering when you'll come home
Baby, when you'll come back to me
Cos I can't fall asleep
Slide on a cloud and light one
Take a walk with me round the sun
Oh boy you got me feeling this, feeling that
So I can't fall asleep

Boy I need you here, I need you by my side
過去那些場景無法再期待

沒你 我的生活只剩空白

曾把愛情想得太完美
這戀情不該這樣收尾
如果再給我一次機會
我不會讓你再次落淚

When I think about you
What we both been through
Thinking bout all the things we could do
Yeah I'm so lonely now 我不知道
腦海中一片空白 還是不明白
也許習慣了 你的存在
我嘗試過 去愛
剩下我一個人對白

It's getting late now
Time my turn off all the lights now
I've been wondering when you'll come home
Baby, when you'll come back to me
Cos I can't fall asleep
Slide on a cloud and light one
Take a walk with me round the sun
Oh boy you got me feeling this, feeling that
So I can't fall asleep
