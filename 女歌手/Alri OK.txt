Alright, alright, alright

We used be good
Be well
Be fine
Be friends
Kick it all the time
I don't see you no more
We don't talk
Don't conversate
What's with all the hate

一起吐煙圈
曖昧
晚睡
聊到天黑
曾經愛過
Remember I loved you before it's cool

想知道你 後來好嗎
See ya stories on the gram
Happy for ya
Richard Mille on ya hand
It's all good, it's all good
And I just wanna let you know

No more Netflix nights staying in and we
忘記曾經交換的秘密
You got problems
I got issues
難過的事放在心底
感傷的話不用跟我提

Don't you miss the times we spent together
Don't try pretend that you don't remember
You got mad and now you're trippin'
說好不變卻又再演
太多理由根本不想猜

So alright, it's ok, it's all good, you win
It's alright, it's ok, it's all good, I'm out

屋頂看夜景
擁抱
睡到自然醒
不刻意

Now we seem like strangers
What's stranger
是你離開
What's stranger

And I don't wanna seem like I'm bitter or salty
或裝作少了你沒關係
愛還在
Remember I loved you before it's cool

想知道你 後來好嗎
See ya stories on the gram
Happy for ya
Richard Mille on ya hand
And that's good
Do you remember the time that's cold

No more Netflix nights staying in and we
忘記曾經交換的秘密
You got problems
I got issues
難過的事放在心底
感傷的話不用跟我提
No, no, no

Don't you miss the times we spent together
Don't try pretend that you don't remember
You got mad and now you're trippin'
說好不變卻又再演
太多理由根本不想猜

So alright, it's ok, it's all good, you win
It's alright, it's ok, it's all good, I'm out
