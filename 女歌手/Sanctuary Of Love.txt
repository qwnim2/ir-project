I'll block the sun from your eyes
I'll make you feel so loved
And when the rain pours
I'll shelter you
Keep you warm
Safe in my arms
So don't hide
From now till a million years away
We'll still belong together
Our love would find a way out
From this hazy crazy world

So come into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for you
Come on and see
Come on around
Come on over and be with me
Come into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for you
Won't you come on and see
Come on around
Come on over

I'll be there out on the streets
To get you autumn leaves
Fresh dew from spring

And the summers heat
The crystal clear icicles of winters time
So you can put your tears away
And all of your regrets
I assure you
Our love is everything to gain
And nothing else to lose

So come into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for you
Come on and see
Come on around
Come on over and be with me
Come into The Sanctuary of Love I've built for you
Won't you come on and see
Come on around
Come on over

I know you haven't made up
Haven't made up your mind
But sooner on later
I know I know you'll
Come come into The Sanctuary of Love for you
