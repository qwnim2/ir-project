Hello God, it's me.　Are you awake?
I know that its late yes, I'm aware
But can you come over to my house
and sit by the sofa close right next to me?
Really need some of your company
I've been thinking about alot of things
How I've been betrayed and been so used
How I'm sick of trying, sick of lying
I'm tired of crying my eyes out sore
I don't wanna do that anymore.

Can you explain
how in the world did I turn out to be this way?
Can you explain
how in the world did things turn out to be this way?
It's easier to find someone to blame

yet it comes with a heavy price to pay
Cos in doing so I've lost my way
I've lost my sense of self, of who I am
Now it's me that I don't understand

Can you explain
how in the world did I turn out to be this way?
Can you explain
how in the world did things turn out to be this way?

Don't know why.
I'm on this Earth...
Hollo God...Are you still there?
