原曲：突然想起你
Lyrics：Lau Pin Lean/Lam Mei May
Music：Wei Chen
Arranger：Wei Chen

Lighting streaks and thunder rules my heart
Raging storms and oceans tear us apart
My dear, you are not here

Something strange has gotton over me
I get the feeling that I lived beneath your skin
Come and walk with me

Lonely in my heart, heaven falls as I reach for the sky
Caught in a spell of this heartache for a million nights
So lay me out in the moon-light, let me breathe
Your lovely name in my window pane to bring me relief

The pouring rain at my door-step is saying to me

Oh where, on where, shall I place my thoughts to make me complete
Forevermore inside our dreams we's always be
Oh yeah, Oh, Oh baby

Lonely in my heart, heaven falls as I reach for the sky
Caught in a spell of this heartache for a million nights
So lay me out in the moon-light, let me breathe
Your lovely name in my window pane to bring me relief

The flowing tears from my eyes will never put out this flame
Eternally rising up and driving me insane
You are the air, keeps it burning, all in vain
The show is over, we will never be the same

The pouring rain at my door-step is saying to me oh
Forevermore inside our dreams we'd always be
