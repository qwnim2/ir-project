Dream, the only way that I can see you Dream, the only place for me to find you
At night, the stars are shining bright I start closing my eyes, you then appear
Though you can't imagine how much I want you
and you won't pay attention on my love for you but now, I'm searching deep inside
And I realise that I only get you in my mind

I am so lonely..My heart is empty But I still try my best to remember you toughly
Since a girl like me can never catch your eyes
When I wake up from my dream then you'll say goodbye
I'm the Sleeping Beauty slept for hundred years
I'm the Sleeping Beauty waiting you right here
I love you, can't you hear? I can't explain so clear Losing you is all I fear

Words can never help to tell I miss you Words can never let you know I'm so blue
Yes I can never tell you why , I'll just think of you and I.. I then smile
I am so lonely..My heart is empty But I still try my best to remember you toughly
Since a girl like me can never catch your eye

When I wake up from my dream then you'll say goodbye
There's only your love can wash my tears And I wish I can always stay by there
You're the one I'm longing for.. You lie within my core Can I dream of you once more
I just wanna hold you close when you lose your soul
I gonna tell you now..gonna tell..
how my love just seems to grow with time

Sleeping Beauty slept for hundred years
I'm the Sleeping Beauty waiting you right here
I love you, can't you hear? I can't explain so clear Losing you is all I fear
There's only your love can wash my tears
And I wish I can always stay by thee
You're the one I'm longing for.. You lie within my core
Can I dream of you once more
