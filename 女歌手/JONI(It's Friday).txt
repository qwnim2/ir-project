Joni, wake up it's friday
Time to catch the new day
I've made breakfast and coffee
What are you waiting for？
The sun is shining,Trees are alive and waiting
The Circus came to town.for the people staying
Oh joni....
Joni wake up it's friday
Time to put on your smile
Lately, you're been unhappy

What's the matter now？
du du du ....Joni. don't go a dreaming
Friday's here to stay
She says no point in weeping
What's done can't be undone
Sn is shining.Birds are alive and singing
Circus came to town.for the people staying
Du du du ....
