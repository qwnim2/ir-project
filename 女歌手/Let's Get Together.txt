With your sultry eyes
Damn you look so fine
Wanna get to get to know you some more
With your sexy body
Oh you drive me crazy
It's a place that I've just got to explore
So look over here honey
You've got what I need baby
I'm not a typical lady
But tonight let's take a chance to go wild baby

Let's get together
Make this an unforgettable night baby
Let's get together
We're gonna have an amazing time baby
Let's get together
Get closer underneath all the stars
Turn the heat up all through the night
Let's light up a fire
And take off across the universe

Bet your lips are sweet

When you kiss me deep
As we move along together as one
Would you hypnotize me
Could you fascinate me
We won't know till we get out of this bar
Not looking for love honey
Don't care if you got money
I just want you so badly
I just need your physical company baby

Let's get together
Make this an unforgettable night baby
Let's get together
We're gonna have an amazing time baby
Let's get together
Get closer underneath all the stars
Turn the heat up all through the night
Let's light up a fire
And take off across the universe

Ooh across the universe
Yeah just you and me
