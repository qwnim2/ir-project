It's been two months
Of little vacations
The sound of your breathing when you sleep
Is my favorite station

Everyday's a holiday
We don't have to get away
Let's order food
A couple drinks
We don't gotta do anything

Still remember the first time I met ya
Confidently dancing by yourself
All the little things are hard to measure
In my brain like books up on a shelf
Mental pictures of you on guitar
Watching TV, laying in the dark
Falling for you was the easy part
Cause before you

I was in rut
You opened me back up
All it took was a little bit of love
To balance me out
You're the plus
To my subtraction
The healing to my pain
Your touch is like a rainbow
After the rain

After the rain
After the rain

After the rain

You took me by surprise
I wasn't expecting
To find someone I like enough
To clean up their messes
I'm anal but you're patient
We're both difficult at times
You don't ask me to
But I cook for you
It's no biggie, I don't mind

Still remember the first time I met ya
Confidently dancing by yourself
All the little things are hard to measure
In my brain like books up on a shelf
Mental pictures of you on guitar
Watching TV, laying in the dark
Falling for you was the easy part
Cause before you

I was in rut
You opened me back up
All it took was a little bit of love
To balance me out
You're the plus
To my subtraction
The healing to my pain
Your touch is like a rainbow
After the rain

After the rain
After the rain
