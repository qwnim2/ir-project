sometime in our lives
we all have pain
we all have sorrow
but if we are wise
we know that there's always tomorrow
chorus:
lean on me
when you're not strong
and I'll be your friend
I'll help you carry on
for it won't be long
till I'm gonna need
somebody to lean on
you can call on me brother
when you need a hand
e all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem
that you'll understand
we all need somebody to lean on
please swallow your pride
if I have things

you need to borrow
for no one can fill
those of your needs
that you won't let show
chorus:
if there is a load
you have to bear
that you can't carry
I'm night up the road
I'll share you load
if you just call me
call me
if you need a friend
call me
if you need a friend
if you ever need a friend
call me
call me
