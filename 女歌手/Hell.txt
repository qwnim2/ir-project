I thought you'll love me forever
I thought you'll love me forever
At last A bet A joke A game you create
Confuse Betray Tell me I want to know
iQue lio! iQue pana! Loco iQue casa mas rara!
Injury Rescue Hopeless

The Deceit Will it's really merciless
I can't eat I can't hear
It's harsh to my ears , harsh to my eyes
Love oh! Hate Well it's really irritant
I can't feel
I can't breathe
Yes I'm falling down , It's just a living
Hell…Hell~

For all this years I have sleep with a devil.
You are the devil….
For all this times I have sleep with a devil.
You are the devil….


You'll never love me forever
You'll never love me forever
Don't want you cheat. Don't want you leave
Self-contradictory. Don't want to know what's real
Foolish game. You and me. Love is not competition

You made me bleed. You saw me bleed.
How cruel you could be. What have you done to me?
I don't know. I don't even know.
What to do and where to go.

The Deceit Will it's really merciless
I can't eat I can't hear
It's harsh to my ears , harsh to my eyes
Love oh! Hate Well it's really irritant
I can't feel
I can't breathe
Yes I'm falling down , It's just a living
How can I see through your eyes ,
see through your heart , thought your soul
I need sunlight. I wanna feel sunrise.
Lead me from dark to dawn…..

The Deceit Will it's really merciless
I can't eat I can't hear
It's harsh to my ears , harsh to my eyes
Love oh! Hate Well it's really irritant
I can't feel
I can't breathe
Yes I'm falling down , It's just a living
Hell~Hell~Hell~
