You know I love you, you know it's true
Give you all my love , babe, tell me what more can I do
I'm Walkin' by myself, I hope you'll understand
I just walk to be your lovin' girl
I love you ya, yes, I love you with my heart and soul
I wouldn't mistreat you for my weight in gold

You know I love you, you know it's true
Give you all my love , babe, tell me what more can I do

I just walk to be your lovin' girl

You know I love you, you know it's true
Give you all my love , babe, what more can I do
Walkin' by myself, I hope you'll understand
I just walk to be your lovin' man
Yes, I'm walkin' by myself, I hope you'll understand
I just walk to be your lovin'
I just walk to be your lovin'
I just walk to be your lovin' man
