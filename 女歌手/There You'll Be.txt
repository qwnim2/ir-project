Lyrics：Diane Warren
Music：Diane Warren

When I think back go these times
And the dreams We left behind
I'll be glad 'cause　I was blessed to get
To have you in my life
When I look back　 go these days
I'll look and see your face　 You were right there for me

In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there always be a place for you
for all my life
I'll keep a part Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
And everywhere I am
There you'll be

Well you showed me How it feels
To feel the sky
Within my reach
And I always
Will remember all The strength you
Gave to me
Your love made me
Make it through
Oh, I owe so much to you
You were right there for me

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there always be a place for you
for all my life
I'll keep a part Of you with me
And everywhere I am There you'll be

'Cause I always saw in you　My light, my strength
And I want to thank you
Now for all the ways
You were right there for me
You were right there for me
For always

In my dreams
I'll always see you soar above the sky
In my heart there always be a place for you
for all my life
I'll keep a part Of you with me
And everywhere I am
There you'll be
And everywhere I am
There you'll be

There you'll be
