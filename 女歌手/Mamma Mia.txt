Written：Benny Andersson/Bjorn Ulvaeus/Stig Andersson

I've been cheated by you since
I don't know when
So I made up my mind
It must come to an end

Look at me now
Will I ever learn
I don't know how
But I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything
O-O-O-Oh

Mamma mia
Here I go again
My my
How can i resist you
Mamma mia
Does it show again
My my just how much
I've miss you

Yes
I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia now I really know
My my
I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about
the things that you do
I can't count all the times that
I've told you we're through
And when you go
When you slam the door
I think you know that
You won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

Just one look and
I can hear a bell ring
One more look and
I forget everything
o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia
Here I go again
My my
How can i resist you
Mamma mia
Does it show again
My my just how much
I've miss you

Yes
I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go
Mamma mia even if i say
Bye bye leave me now

Or never
Mamma mia
it's a game we play
Bey bye
Doesn't mean forever

Mamma mia
Here I go again
My my
How can i resist you
Mamma mia
Does it show again
My my just how much
I've miss you

Yes
I've been brokenhearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why why did I ever let you go

Mamma mia
Now I really know
My my
I could never let you go

Mamma mia
Now I really know
My my
I could never let you go
