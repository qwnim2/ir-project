Is your smile genuine
Are you that really kind
Do you like money &amp; what it can bring

Where would you wanna hide
What would you seek
Would you want what you thought
what you want if no one can see

See the pretty lights pretty smiles
a long way from home
See the wretched stars burnt-out sun
Out on your own

See our story come - sing along
What would you know
This is your song

Is your smile genuine
Are you that really kind
Do you like money &amp; what it can bring

Where would you wanna hide
What would you seek
Would you want what you thought
what you want if no one can see

Is your smile genuine
Are you that really kind
Do you like money &amp; what it can bring

Where would you wanna hide
What would you seek

Would you want what you thought
what you want if no one can see

See the pretty lights pretty smiles
a long way from home
See the wretched stars burnt-out sun
Out on your own

See our story come - sing along
What would you know
This is your song


Oh I know where I'd rather be
So I'm holding on &amp; going strong
Join the race, I'll be first place
Give me glue, we'll be good as new

See the pretty lights pretty smiles
a long way from home
See the pretty lights pretty smiles
a long way from home
See the wretched stars burnt-out sun
Out on your own
See the wretched stars burnt-out sun
Out on your own

See our story come - sing along
What would you know
This is your song
