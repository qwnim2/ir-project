Just wanna do nothing with you
Nothing with you
Just wanna do nothing, nothing
Nothing with you
Spend all of my time up on you
My time up on you
Spend all of my time up
My time up
My time up on you

Baby, maybe we could be lovers
Baby, maybe we could be friends
I don't mind wasting my time
If my time is spent wasted with you, it's well spent, yeah
It's well spent, yeah
It's well spent, yeah
It's well spent, yeah

Just wanna do nothing with you
Nothing with you
Just wanna do nothing, nothing
Nothing with you
Spend all of my time up on you
My time up on you
Spend all of my time up
My time up
My time up on you

Take your time to know me

If you're really wanna know me
If you're tryna be a homie
Take your time to know me

We don't have to find out
(If you're really wanna know me)

Take your time to know me
Take your time to know me

It's well spent, yeah
It's well spent, yeah yeah

We go drifting, drifting
Drifting away
We go drifting, drifting
Drifting away

Just wanna do nothing with you
Nothing with you
Just wanna do nothing, nothing
Nothing with you
Spend all of my time up on you
My time up on you
Spend all of my time up
My time up
My time up on you

I don't mind wasting my time
If it's you by my side
And I know that it's all real with you
