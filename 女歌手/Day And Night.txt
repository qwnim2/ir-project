Too much of a good thing
Could just never be enough
And it brings you down
It makes you fear you'll lose it somehow
And that's how you make me feel
And that's how you make me feel

So can I need you in my life?
Can I keep you close to me
Day &amp; Night?

Can I need you forever?
I wanna have you close to me Day &amp; Night

I want something that's beautiful
A love full of emotions &amp; desire
And something oh so innocent
And yet so far beyond words
That you can't explain
