You shut the door behind you
Telling me, I'm not the person I used to be
Perhaps an apology ain't enough when everything is so messed up
Good things will happen to good people
Well, I think I must have done something terrible
The cake I brought back isn't your flavor
So I alone ate them all

My stomach started to ache
I think it must be the cake I ate
I think it must be mistakes I made

I'm losing someone who understand me
I'm losing someone who understand me
Not you, you said

My stomach started to ache
I think it must be the cake I ate
I think it must be mistakes I made

I'm losing someone who understand me
I'm losing someone who understand me
I'm losing someone who understand me
Not you, you said
