I don't wanna lose you,
I don't wanna use you
just to have sombody by my side
And I don't wanna hate you
I don't wanna take you
But I don't wanna be the one to cry
That don't really matter to anyone, anymore
But like a fool I keep losing my place
And I keep seeing you walk through that door

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't trust.
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

Now I could never change you
I don't wanna blame you
Baby you don't have to take the fall
Yes I may have hurt you
But I did not desert you
Maybe I just want to have it all

It makes a sound like thunder
It makes me feel like rain
And like a fool who will never see the truth
I keep thinking something's gonna change

But there's a danger in loving somebody too much
And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust
There's a reason why people don't stay where they are
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough

And there's no way home
when it's late at night and you're all alone
Are there things that you wanted to say
Do you feel me beside you in your bed
there beside you where I used to lay

And there's a Danger in loving somebody too much
And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch
There's a reason why people don't stay who they are
Cause baby sometimes love just ain't enough
Baby sometimes love just ain't enough


[中譯]
不願失去你　不願利用你　只願有人長伴我側
並不想恨你　不想征服你　只是不想再哭泣
不再有所謂　像個傻瓜　我不斷退讓　不停看著你來去
愛一個人太深很危險　你知道自己的心不可信有多可悲
人們總是學不乖　寶貝　有時愛就是不足夠
既然無法改變你　我也不怪你
寶貝你無須承擔這個過錯
是的　我也許傷過你　但也從未想要遺棄你
也許我太過貪心　貪求迴盪如雷　就像快下起雨一樣
像個永遠看不清事實的傻子　滿心相信有些事終究會改變
愛一個人太深很危險　你知道自己的心不可信有多可悲
人們總是學不乖　寶貝　有時愛就是不足夠
當夜色已晚　而你孤單一人　卻找不到回家的路
你有什麼話要說嗎　你可在床邊感到我的陪伴　我曾睡臥的床邊
愛一個人太深很危險　你知道自己的心不可信有多可悲
人們總是學不乖　寶貝　因為有時愛就是不足夠
寶貝　有時愛就是不足夠
