My friend, I know you'll be there if I'm feeling blue
My friend, even though we're worlds apart
And you think you haven't got the style
To stand alongside, superstars
My friend, even though how everything turned out wrong
My friend, after all it's just a passing phase
You're not the only one to belleve'
That you deserve a damn much better life
So you can say what you want
Let yourself be free, let your heart guide you, Cry if you want
I won't desert you, I won't be far
My friend, no one knows me well like how you do
My friend, always up for the long conversations
About my indecisions in love

My erratic moods, you're hart to find

My friend, I know I'll be there if you're feeling blue
My friend, even though we're worlds apart
We might be walking in two directions
But we know where each is heading to
So you can laugh all want
Let yourself be free. I won't let you down
Do what you want.Live out your big dreams. I'd understand
Say what you want.Let yourself be free, let your heart guide you
Cry if you want.I won't desert you. I won't be far away....
