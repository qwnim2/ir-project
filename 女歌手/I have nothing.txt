Share my life take me for what I am cause I'll never change
All my colors for you
Take my love I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are and everything that you do

I don't really need to look very much further
I don't want to have to go Where you don't follow
I won't hold it back again this passion inside
Can't run from myself there's no where to hide
Your love I remember-forever well

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
stay in my arms lf you dare Must I imaging you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing Nothing Nothing

lf I don't have you you you you you

You see through right to the heart of me
You break down my walls With the strength of your love
I never knew love like I've known it with you
Whether memory survive One I can hold on to

Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Sstay in my arms lf you dare Mush I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me no
Don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing Nothing Nothing
lf I don't have you you
If I don't have you oh
