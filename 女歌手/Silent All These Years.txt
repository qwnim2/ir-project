Excuse me but can I be you for a while
My dog won't bite if you sit real still
I got the Anti-Christ in the kitchen yellin' at me again
Yeah I can hear that

Been saved again by the garbage truck
I got something to say you know but nothing comes
Yes I know what you think of me you never shut up
Yeah I can hear that

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes I said sometimes I hear my voice and it's been
here
silent all these years

So you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts
What's so amazing about really deep thoughts
Boy you best pray that I bleed real soon
How's that thought for you

My scream got lost in a paper cup
You think there's a heaven where some screams have gone
I got 25 bucks and a cracker do you think it's enough
To get us there

Cos' what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of his with her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes
I said sometimes
I hear my voice and it's been
here
silent all these..

Years go by will I still be waiting
For somebody else to understand

Years go by if I'm stripped of my beauty
And the orange clouds raining in my head
Years go by will I choke on my tears
Till finally there is nothing left
One more casualty
You know we're too
easy
easy
easy

Well I love the way we communicate
Your eyes focus on my funny lip shape
Let's hear what you think of me now
but baby don't look up
The sky is falling

Your mother shows up in a nasty dress
It's your turn now to stand where I stand
Everybody lookin' at you
here take hold of my hand
Yeah I can hear them

But what if I'm a mermaid
In these jeans of yours with her name still on it
Hey but I don't care
Cause sometimes
I said sometimes I hear my voice
I hear my voice
I hear my voice
And it's been
here
silent all these years
I've been here
silent all these years
Silent all these
Silent all these years





[中譯]

抱歉　我能否扮演你一會兒　只要你坐好　我的狗就不開口
廚房裡的怪教徒　又對著我吼　Yeah　我聽見了
垃圾車再次救了我　有話要說　卻又說不出口
我知道自己在你眼中的樣子　你從不住口　Yeah　我聽見了
如果我是隻美人魚　穿他的牛仔褲　上面還留著她的名
但我不在乎　因為有時候　我是說有時候　我聽見自己的聲音　縈繞在此　已沉默多年
這麼說　你找到那個心思複雜的女孩了　心思複雜有什麼好訝異
男孩　你最好祈禱我的血流的快　你覺得這個念頭怎樣　我的吶喊消失在紙杯中
你認為吶喊消失的地方就有天堂　我有25塊錢和一塊餅乾　你想這夠帶我們到天堂嗎
時光流逝　我還會等待嗎　等待能有個人瞭解我
時光流逝　如果我美貌不再　我的世界也會慘澹一片*
時光流逝　我會哽住淚水　直到什麼也不剩　又一個受害者
你知道我們都太容易受傷　我愛極我們溝通的方式
你的眼盯著我奇怪的唇形看　現在來聽聽你對我的看法　但　寶貝　別抬頭看　天空就要低垂
你媽媽穿著一件髒衣服出現　現在輪到你嘗嘗我的滋味了
每個人都在看你　來　別介意握住我的手　Yeah　我聽見他們說
如果我是隻美人魚　穿他的牛仔褲　上面還留著她的名
但我不在乎　因為有時候　我是說有時候　我聽見自己的聲音　縈繞在此　已沉默多年
