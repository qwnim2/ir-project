監製：伊秩弘將 / 小原芳信

I don't need some guy to wine and dine me all the time
I don't need some other guy to tell me I look fine
I won't hear a lie even if it's all you have to say
No more empty promises to keep me hanging on a line

Just as the music plays on and on each and every day
Hey Hey　There is no other way
Simply smile a little smile for you
No matter what you do

Love yourself every way
Feeling good that's your natural right
Love yourself every day
Looking good all thru' day and night
You oughtta know by now baby
Feeling love is all you need to be a lady

All I need's a lover who'll stand by me thru' and thru'
And I need a love that's gonna stay forever true
I won't care at all even if you never say 'I love you'
I've got better things to do to make my dreams come true

Just as the music plays on and on each and every day

Hey Hey　There is no other way
Simply smile a little smile for you
No matter what you do

Love yourself every way
Feeling good that's your natural right
Love yourself every day
Looking good all thru' day and night
You oughtta know by now baby
Loving life is all you need to be a lady

And if the music dies life goes on each and every day
Hey Hey　There is no other way
Just simply smile a little smile for you
No matter what you do

Love yourself every way
Feeling good that's your natural right
Love yourself every way
Looking good all thru' day and night

Love yourself every way
Walking tall hold your head up high
Love yourself every day
Close your eyes feel the love inside
You oughtta know by now baby
Loving life is all you need to be a lady
