On the quiet street in the city
A little old man walked alone
Shuffling through the autumn afternoon
And the autumn leaves reminded him
Another summer's come and gone
He had a long long midnight ahead waiting for June
The among the leaves near an orphan's home
A piece of paper caught his eyes
And he stood to pick it up with trembling hands
And as he read the childish writing
The old man began to cry
'Cause the words burned inside him like a brand
' 'Whoever finds this , I love you
Whover finds this , I need you
I even got no one to talk to
So , whoever finds this , I love you '
Well , the old man's eyes searched the orphan's home
And came to rest upon a child

With her nose pressed up against the window pane
And the old man knew he'd found a friend at last
So he waved at her and smiled
And they both knew they'd spend the winter
Laughing at the rain
And they did spend the winter laughing at the rain ,
Talking through the fence ,
Exchanging little gifts they've made for each other.
The old man wold carve toys,
And the little girl would draw pictures fo beautiful ladies
And they laughed a lot.
But then one day, on the first of June,
The lttle girl ran to the fence -- the old man wasn't there.
And , somehow she knew he was never coming beck.
So she went back to her lttle room , took a crayon 　 And wrote :
' 'Whoever finds this , I love you 　 Whoever finds this , I need you
I even got no one to talk to 　 So , whoever finds this , I love you '
