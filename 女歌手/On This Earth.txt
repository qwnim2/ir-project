On this earth
Under the deep blue sea
And in the sky
That's where you'll find my hart &amp; soul
That's where you'll my precious love
If you wanna have it you know where to find

In your heart
In your eyes In your mind
And in your life
That's where I know I wanna be
That's where I know that I belong
If I were blindfolded I'd still know where to go

I know I love you
You adore me
Think our love is heaven sent
But the world's seen so cruel that
We don't know what's gonna last
I know I love you
You adore me
But would our love find the strength?
I can't help but to wonder where do we go from here
