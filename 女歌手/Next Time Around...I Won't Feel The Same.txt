Who'd ever thought you would misunderstand?
It's always the case you were right I was wrong
I think it's true that I should have a plan
If you do that again it's goodbye

Could it be that we were not meant to be?
I've cried enough tears to fill up a big sea
But I'm not the kind to live on misery
Yet I don't want to be part of you history

I've tried to get close to you
I've been by your side

But it's always the case that I've never been true
If nothing else works for you we'll meet again
But next time around
No, I won't be the same

Finally it's time that I, turn off the lights
Leave all behind that's yours and take what mine
Try not to call or come ringing your bell
Cos it's something to do with my pride
