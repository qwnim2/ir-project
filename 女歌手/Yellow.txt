Featuring：Coldplay

Look at the stars; look how they shine for you
And everything you do
Yeah, they were all yellow

I came along; i wrote a song for you
And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then i took my turn
Oh what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

Your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
D'you know?
You know i love you so
You know i love you so

I swam across; i jumped across for you
Oh what a thing to do
'cos you were all yellow

I drew a line; i drew a line for you

Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

And your skin, oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
D'you know?
For you i bleed myself dry
For you i bleed myself dry

It's true
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for＃
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine for you
Look how they shine

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And all the things that you do

金黃色
詞:Coldplay
曲:Coldplay

抬頭仰望繁星點點
看著它們為妳散發的迷人光芒
在妳的膽怯小心裡
都存在一種金黃色

我一路獨自走來
為妳，我作了一首情歌
在妳膽怯小心背後
都有著金黃色的回憶

我恣意的漫步遊走
是什麼樣的事情等待著實現呢？
那是種金黃色的美好體驗

妳的肌膚
妳的每一吋肌膚
都幻化為美麗的生活點滴
妳明白我對妳的愛有多深
相信我給妳的付出有多真

我為妳穿越海洋
為妳跨越山谷
讓我瘋狂付出的原因為何？
只因為妳在我的心中永遠迷人脫俗

我畫了一條線
為妳，畫出我倆唯一的界線等著妳跨越
使我想像幸福的動機為何？
只為了得到美麗如妳的重視

妳的肌膚
妳的每一吋肌膚
都幻化為美麗的生活點滴
妳知道我願意為了妳而犧牲自己
縱使我的生命已不再留有任何痕跡

我對妳的表白是如此真實，星星的確為妳散發光芒
看著它們為妳散發的迷人光芒
看著它們如何為妳散發光芒
看著它們為妳散發著迷人光芒
看著它們為妳散發著迷人光芒
看著它們如何散發出迷人光芒

抬頭仰望繁星點點
看著它們為妳散發的迷人光芒
就在妳的舉手投足之間
