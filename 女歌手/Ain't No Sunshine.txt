Lyrics：Bill Withers
Music：Bill Withers

Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
It's not warm
When he's away

Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
And he's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away

Wonder this time
Where he's gone
Wonder if he's gonna stay

Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
And this house
Just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

And I know I know...
I believe
I'm alone

Ain't no sunshine

When he's gone

Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
Only darkness everyday

Ain't no sunshine
And this house
Just ain't no home
Anytime he goes away

Ain't no sunshine
Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone

And he's always gone too long
Anytime he goes away

Ain't no sun
Ain't no sun
And he's always gone too lone

Ain't no sunshine
When he's gone
