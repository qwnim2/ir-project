凌晨四點手機響了
我看到你訊息傳來了
Even when we ain't together, together

原本跟你過得快樂
但這感情只給我傷痕
But now we just friends so don't holla, holla

Hey 有點晚發現
Hey 你的黑眼圈
Hey 讓我好傻眼

Don't want none of them 4am calls
不要再 LINE 我說你愛我
I don't wanna fuck with you no more
已讀不回你還打給我
Cos you should know what's best for you, best for you
Don't want none of them 4am calls
不要再 LINE 我說你愛我

Just let the shit fade away
Just let go things will be okay
Just let that shit drift away
Keep them bitches far away
Just let the shit fade away
Just let go things will be okay
Just let that shit drift away
Keep them bitches far away
From me

我終於想通已離開了

我終於懂愛你是錯的
我現在不想被你管了 被你管了
Tho the sex kept us together
I know on my own that I'm stronger
I come on my own a lot easier, easier
Hey, it's fine with me
Hey, it's alright with me
Hey, it's ok with me

Don't want none of them 4am calls
不要再 LINE 我說你愛我
I don't wanna fuck with you no more
已讀不回你還打給我
Cos you should know what's best for you, best for you
You should know what's best for you, best for you
Don't want none of them 4am calls
不要再 LINE 我說你愛我 (Don't wanna fuck with you no more)
I don't wanna fuck with you no more
已讀不回你還打給我 (Don't wanna fuck with you no more)
Cos you should know what's best for you, best for you
Don't want none of them 4am calls
不要再 LINE 我說你愛我

Just let the shit fade away
Just let go things will be okay (Things will be okay)
Just let that shit drift away (Things will be okay)
Keep them bitches far away (Far away from me)
Just let the shit fade away
Just let go things will be okay (Drift away)
Just let that shit drift away
Keep them bitches
Far away from me
