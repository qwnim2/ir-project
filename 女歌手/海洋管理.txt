Ocean keeper's sitting on
the bench when seasons change
Ocean keeper's never seen never

Ocean keeper's watching
people cry their trouble away
Ocean keeper tells them it will fade

Glean the tears and glean
the loneliness that people left
Glean the empty and the lust on shore
Glean the bodies glean a millions of reptilian soul
Throw in water everything will flow

1 and 2 and 3 hearts are counted by the gangsters
Ocean keeper says
They'll be better in the wave
