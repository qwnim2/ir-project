'伸伸懶腰'原曲

Saturday of 1st December
I'm left with me and a 'friend'
Counting tables
Counting crows
Counting the days I spend revolving the sun

(If I could) Drive! Drive casually
I'll drive myself to sanity
I won't be walking all night
Live life as it is
I'll live my life incessantly
I'll be nowhere out of sight

Liberation!
Relocation!
I must get out of this house
Looking forward
Looking for you
Looking for someone to jump into my car

It's hard enough to try to explain
And if I did you won't understand
It's hard enought to try to fit it
There must be a somewhat better plan
