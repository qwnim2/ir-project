Verse
I need some space but still need love
It's different here without you
I fear the past way too much
The present's here but I'm still not

Chorus 1
Guess I'll let the future In
Instead of running
Instead of fighting
I'll just fall
No more second guessing
I'm so done with struggling
Sinking in the deep end
If we let the future in
We could start again

Chorus 2
Just you and I
Just one more, one more time, you and I
Just one more, one more time
one more, one more time
If we let the future in
We could start again
Just you and I
Just one more, one more time, you and i
Just one more, one more time
one more, one more time
If we let the future in
We could start again
Just you and I

Verse II
I'm insecure, and I'm brittle
And still unsure which is worse
You trying to hurt me with your words
Or when I learned I did it first

Chorus 1
Guess I'll let the future In
Instead of running
Instead of fighting
I'll just fall
No more second guessing
I'm so done with struggling
Sinking in the deep end
If we let the future in
We could start again

Chorus 2
Just you and I
Just one more, one more time, you and I
Just one more, one more time
one more, one more time
If we let the future in
We could start again
Just you and I
Just one more, one more time, you and i
Just one more, one more time
one more, one more time
If we let the future in
We could start again
Just you and I

Chorus Redux
Just you and I
Just one more, one more time, you and I
Just one more, one more time
one more, one more time
If we let the future in
We could start again
Just you and I
Just one more, one more time, you and i
Just one more, one more time
one more, one more time
If we let the future in
We could start again
Just you and I

you and I.....
