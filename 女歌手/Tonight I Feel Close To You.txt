Close my eyes and feel your mind
Time has passed
I walked like a shadow
Never knew
What I am going through
You touch my heart and take my breath away

Whisper on the wind so softly
Let the bright stars fill our dreams with love
Reach for your hand (your hold is my key)
and you show me the way

Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one
(I wish we could stay forever as one)

All the tears that haunt my past
You promised
It'll be better tomorrow
play that song
You and I listened to
And let it gently ease our pain

Tender rain drops from the blue sky
Flowers blooming, life is so divine

like sunlight on a stream (you're holding my key)
You show the world to me

Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one

So much love in this beautiful world
Search for the brightest star in the sky
You will find the meaning of love
Don't be afraid (Don't be afraid)
Just be yourself (Just be yourself)
We need this love... I've never knew

Tonight, I feel close to you
You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one

Tonight, I feel close to you

You open my door and light the sky above
When I need a friend, you are there right by my side
I wish we could stay as one
I wish we could stay forever as one
