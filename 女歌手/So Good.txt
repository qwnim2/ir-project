hey there, I think I'm alive again,
hey there, I think I'm show theworld how I feel,
you see I'm going commercial,
I'm loving the mainstream,
I'm hoping for Billboard,
if not I'm then still hot,
not talking about daydreams,
I'm talking about maybes,
Let's turn to reality it's making me feel


so good
(the word should fall in love tonight)
it's so good
(I know it's gonna be alright)
cause tonight I think I wanna
Dance all night but I just might
paint this city red,black and white,
Let's pick flowers and not pick fights,
whatever you wanna do is cool,come on.


I got an aeroplane(it's not a G6),
but it's got wings. x2


Hey Joe,we got need for guns,
we've got Strawberry Fields for fun,Let's go run,
you see I'm going commercial,
I'm loving the mainstream,
Money from billboard,
I'll spent it on your dog,(laugh)
I'm starting to daydream,
forget about maybes,that never go places,


I starting to feel so good
(don't you wanna fall in love tonight)

it's all good
(I know it's gonna be alright)
cause tonight I think I wanna
Dance all night but I just might
paint this city red,black and white,
Let's pick flowers and not pick fights,
whatever you wanna do is cool,come on.


RAP: I'm feeling so good like everyday was set in Disneyland,
you see this youtube screen and you feel like you're in Disneyland,
you try to diss me man but I don't think you can,
you try to step to this I make you run like the Taliban.


Let's run away now,Let's go away and get the Hef out of here
Let's run away now,Let's go away and get the Hef out of here


Cause I'm into feeling
so good
(don't you wanna fall in love tonight)
it's all good
(I know it's gonna be alright)
cause tonight I think I wanna
Dance all night but I just might
paint this city red,black and white,
Let's pick flowers and not pick fights,
whatever you wanna do is cool,come on.


2012 is a myth,
And I'm gonna live forever, baby,
Everything is gonna be so good.
I'm so good,
It's all good.
