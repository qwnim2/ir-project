Lyrics：Paul Moos
Music：Azlan Abu Hassan/Hawa Junaidi/Latifah Y

See the tear in your eyes
Let it fall from the sky
Meet the rainbow as it comes behind

There's a vision for you
That you're not letting through
Time for letting go that state of mind

It's better to love and to lose, so they say
Than never have loved at all
So don't hang around feeling sad, looking down
It's a lesson, you might as well learn

C'est la vie

You give and you get, you live and you let
No-one said it was easy

Et d'amour
You never look back, never ever regret
Letting go it's not easy

What is up without down
Or the lost without found
What is love without a little pain

Sometimes the one thing you fear
Keeps on holding you there
Time for giving up the crying game

Love is amazing when you figure it out
