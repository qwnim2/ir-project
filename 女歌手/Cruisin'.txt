It's been a minute, girl, I know you feelin' lost
Girlfriends on the telephone talkin' shit to you, because
All this yada yada yak, chatta chatta chatt chit chit chat
I'ma rather get a gat, blat blat blat blat blat blat blat blat
You ain't never heard a rap so sick
You might need a doctor tonight
I might need a nurse, bedside service, alright
Been a couple years, know you ain't seen me you're blind
Let me put the shades on, Stevie, bae, you're mine

I'ma be there Mondays till Sundays, baby, you're mine
(24/7, 7-11, baby, come get you more)
I'ma be there wrong way right way, whatever you like
(Don't go there, shorty, don't you go there, shorty)
There's a couple of things to know
I don't need money or rocks that glow
Hope it's alright
(If it's ok with you, I'm just trying to be down with you
Ride with you, Netflix and chill with you, bae)
Hope it's alright

Oooooh, I'd like to go cruisin' with you
Let's move
So many things, you can't own everything
But I wrote a blank cheque for love
Oooooh, I wanna go cruisin' with you
Let's move
(We should try to go to aim for the moon
If not land on the stars, maybe I'll find a bar)
And a spaceship that I bought for you

I ain't got no problems, no beef with you
Other people got 99 problems, they boo
I'm just tryna cuff you, they just tryna puff you
They just tryna blow smoke in your face

This is how that thing taste
I'm just tryna party and bullshit, no bullshit and drama
They don't make no commas, make jokes bout your mama
(Hope it's alright)
If it's ok with you, I'm just trying to be down with you
Ride with you, Netflix and chill with you, bae

Oooooh, I'd like to go cruisin' with you
Let's move
So many things, you can't own everything
But I wrote a blank cheque for love
Oooooh, I wanna go cruisin' with you
Let's move
(We should try to go to aim for the moon
If not land on the stars, maybe I'll find a bar)
And a spaceship that I bought for you
For you, for you, for you, for you

Babygirl, drama's spelt D-R-A-M-A
I can go head to head, toe to toe
A day all day
I can go West Coast beat, East Coast flow
I can make a risk while things blow
I'm just tryna be your gravity
Cause I'm always down

Oooooh, I'd like to go cruisin' with you
Let's move
So many things, you can't own everything
But I wrote a blank cheque for love
Oooooh, I wanna go cruisin' with you
Let's move
(We should try to go to aim for the moon
If not land on the stars, maybe I'll find a bar)
And a spaceship that I bought for you
And a spaceship that I bought for you
And a spaceship that I bought for you
