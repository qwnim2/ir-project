All the times I waited, all the times I tried
It never seems to go my way

Don't want no more excuses
See through all your bullshit
Done pretending that you'll change

So it's fair game, I don't belong to you
Body, mind and soul we're through
Right or wrong, walk out for something new
This the last time you'll hear me say

Oh
Shouldn't keep on calling
I know that I'm not falling
This time
Oh
Try to leave me hurting
Don't matter cos I'm learning
For love
We used to fall in so deep
You used to cut me so deep
Now I know I'm taking my time

Oh baby I know
Oh baby I know

You'll never change my mind
You'll never change my mind

Yeah, I'm not going away
我要你 我要你知道
跟我說還能有誰
不吃藥 就讓你睡著

我承認我犯的罪
I never meant to hurt your feelings, yeah
手機也交給你 yeah
Ain't no playing games

Yeah 還有許多城市要去
和你 yeah 嚐遍不同的生活
Woo yeah, baby, tell me what you what, yeah
Look baby, you are what I want, yeah

我不想顯得太囉嗦
反正你聽我說了那麼多
Baby I'm still loving you

Oh
Shouldn't keep on calling
I know that I'm not falling
This time
Oh
Try to leave me hurting
Don't matter cos I'm learning
For love
We used to fall in so deep
You used to cut me so deep
Now I know I'm taking my time

Oh baby I know
Oh baby I know

You'll never change my mind
You'll never change my mind

(I never change my mind, baby
I never change my mind
And Imma take my time to change your mind)
