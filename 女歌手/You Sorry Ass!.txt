Didn't I do my best to tell you？
Didn't I hear everything you said？
didn't I put everything down just to make your day？
Now I'm too tired to play
People walking past us as we linger
Eventhough there is not much to see
Maybe you should try your luck on someone else
Cause I can't stand you no more！
I hope someday you will find someone
And she will treat you like you treated me
Then how you'll fall apart now I should wonder？
And so if you should think that I'll be awake
To wait for your call half past three
Think again my love, YOU SORRY ASS！
For every little goodintention I had
You turned them down and walked away

Now, I don't give a damn, don't wanna condescend
There's only me myself to defend
I hope someday you will find someone
And she will treat you like you treated me
Them how you'll fall apart now I should wonder？
I'll remember how the first time we made out
Then you said we should just be friends
Don't ask for I love you's. YOU SORRY ASS！
Oh, Jim Beam. kim. your stupid kitty, your tarots.
Scuba dives and spoons
Oh, Jim Beam. Kim. your stupid kitty.
I'll be over you too soon. YOU SORRY ASS！
YOU WORRY ASS！！
