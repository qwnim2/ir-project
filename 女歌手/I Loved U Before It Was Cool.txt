One big room
Full of whack witches
One big room
Full of whack witches

Hey,I was just wondering how you were
It's been a while since I heard from you
Many things happen while you're gone
I think the world changed about three times
I better get my shit together
This love won't last forever
That's why I didn't invest in you
After the night is through
You'll know that I'm made for you
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more

One big room
Full of whack witches
One big room
Full of whack witches
One big room
Full of whack witches
One big room
Full of whack witches

'Biggie,Gimme One More Chance'
And now I'm feelin so 94

Many things happen while you're gone
And now the world changed
And I don't want you
You better get my shit together
This love won't last forever
That's why I didn't invest in you
After the song is through
I'm no longer made for you
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more

Sorry sorry baby I'm just into you
You're not my kinda cool
Baby,if we imagine
All the things in life
That aren't really real
Go head and give it up
Don't be afraid
Everything in life is ok
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more
I loved you before it was cool
But I don't think I love you no more
