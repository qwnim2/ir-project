Hey I don't think I got your name
I don't even know where you stay
Where you stay
Oh hey
Don't you think it might be fate?
How we met on a boring day
Yeah it's fate

Chorus:
I don't know whether if I'd ever see you again
But I'd sure like to try to see you once again

Whether if we would make it as lovers or friends
I wish on a star
So I could see you again

Hey I think about you everyday
I say my prayers say my grace
Say them loud loud
Ooh hey
I can't forget your handsome face
It's a sweet and bitter taste
Sweet and bitter taste
