Have you been around me lately？Funny how long it's been
Since the day you even noticed.We don't have around anymore
And the days go by.Like the water that runs dry
And the years went by.I can't imagine what went wrong
Last night I heard the piano playing
You should lave been there anyway
And I was in my best blue satin
You should have seen me anyway
Didn't we used to think no one can
But us baby？So what does it mean to you now
Remembering me seems so hard for you, Now lately
So how do you plead？How many times do we all cherish
How little things are meant to be
How many times do we remember
They're the ones who make who we are
