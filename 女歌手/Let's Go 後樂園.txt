(Yah, C'mon) (You know, I've been thinking)
[What's up, Elva]
(Well) [If you got something to say, then say it]
(Listen up, Listen up)

這一首歌真的不想講單戀
真的不想首首歌只講相戀 [That's true]
這一生中真的不只得苦戀
這一首歌很想講青春苦短

前在暗戀　後要眷戀
始終會構成傷損
忘掉正選　別要副選

oh~聯朋結黨找去路
女生都跳舞
Yah~去跳舞那會說no
You gotta let it go

[So let me get this straight,
You're saying no strings attached, no catch.
(Does it seem that for fetched?)
Nah, I think you're right,
I think that love is overrated,
Some girls are really faded, they're way to dedicated.
(But some guys are too.) That's true.]

這一生中當然少不得初戀
初戀當然終於只得到失戀 [Yah, more flavor]
失戀所損失的都不必貪戀
誰聽到快到後樂園遊一圈

離愁別恨太過土
賣弄友愛會更糟
講戀愛有甚麼好
寧願跳高　別要跳蚤

oh~聯朋結黨找去路
女生都跳舞
Yah~去跳舞那會說no
You gotta let it go

[Well let me tell you what I think,
I'll give you a piece of my mind,
cuz everything you lead me on.
You make me stop on a dime.
It's all good if you wanna flaunt it,
I wanna get up on it, but stop the tease.
Just say please, if you really want it,
cuz we can take it fast or slow just don't say no.
What are you all getting crazy for, it's either do or don't,
it's either will or won't, it's rather simple.
So cut the crap c'mon lets get it on.
But if it's another one of those games,
that you're playing and I happen to know.
Then babe, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to let you go.]

(But there's players, out there, who don't care.
If I get hurt or not, cuz I know what's up.
I'm all about feeling, wanna know with who I'm dealing.
I had enough. I need a men that sends me reeling.)

前在暗戀　後要眷戀
始終會構成傷損
忘掉正選　別要副選

oh~聯朋結黨找去路
女生都跳舞
Yah~去跳舞那會說no
You gotta let it go
[Listen up, Listen up, Yah]

oh~聯朋結黨找去路
女生都跳舞
Yah~去跳舞那會說no
You gotta let it go

[Let it go, yah, that's right]
[Let it go, yah, that's right]
[Let it go, yah, that's right]
[Let it go, yah, that's right]
[Let it go, yah, that's right]
