Faking a smile. I was talking to you
Did you know I was tired of feeling the blue
So I thought of the sun
And I thought of the rain
Thought of the weather what it's doing today
If it fine, fine, fine.
Making a scene for the people to see
Did you know you were boring the hell out of me
So I thought of the sun
And I thought of the rain
Thought of the weather what it's doing today

Will it shine shine shine
I wanna sit around waiting for nothing
I wanna walk around feeling down
I wanna get that silly high on cigarettes
I wanna spin about round and round!
Du du du du du ........
High, high....high!!
Du du du du du ........round and round
Du du du du du ....(till end)
