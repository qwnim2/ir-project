I had a cat　something pretty
something small　something naive
won't tell you lies　won't ask you why

I love my cat　something really
something bigger　something guilty
it takes your time　it takes your trust
so easy

I saw a cat without the social lines
without a good day　without an eclipse
nobody helps me　like I did to my little pussy
give a hand to anyone　anyone,anyone
