作詞：Tim Carr

編曲：嚴爵

No need to be
Worried, I'll see
Wandering far, far away
There's too much to see
But I am too sleepy
I'll happily follow you, falling sun

Wake me, when we
Can go out and be
Wanderers far, far away
Together we'll hold hands
Whatever happens
I'm happy to be there with you

Birds fly and go by

The daylight, all my
Worries are far, far away
Holding our hands
We'll see what happens
I'll happily follow you, falling sun

Finally I see
I'm not too sleepy
Oh my! The sights to be seen
Sliver of silver
The moon shows and it glows
Once the night comes to life
Once the night comes to life

Sleepy but safer
Right now I savour
My pillow and silk linen sheets
