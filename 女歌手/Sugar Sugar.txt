Sugar Oh～ honey honey
You are my candy boy And you've got me waiting you

Honey Oh～ sugar sugar
You are my candy boy And you've got me waiting you

I just can't believe The loveliness of loving you

I just can't believe The one I love can feel it too

Sugar Oh～ honey honey.
You are my candy boy And you've got me waiting you

When I kissed you, Boy
I know how sweet a kiss could be..
Like the silver sunshine Pour your sweetness over me
