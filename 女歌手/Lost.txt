Lyrics：Tanya
Music：Tanya

I never knew what I had lost
Till you were thousand miles away
I laid out all the memories
Wandering why I let you go away in tears
Wandering why I pushed you away
Tell all the damage had been done
Then knew I'd lost the best of me

Cos you loved me the most
Cos you're all the things that I've been yearning for
Cos you knew me the most
Cos it hurts so bad when you're not around

I close my eyes so I won't see
The fact that you're not coming back

Shattered dreams and broken hearts
Left in pieces for the night to pick them up
Oh then I'll get carried away
Putting them back together
Yet they never looked so incomplete

Cos you loved me the most
Cos you're all the things that I've been yearning for
Cos you knew me the most
Cos it hurts so bad when you're not around

Was love just passing by?
Were we only not meant to be?
When time gets to the truth so sunddenly
I just don't want to believe....
