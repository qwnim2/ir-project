Hey boy

Say that you're be hanging our,
afternoon out with the boys?
(Boys ,Boys, with your Material Boys)

All you ever care about, is your electronic toys,
( I just wish your PSP, would run out of battery)

How about we go watch a movie,
how about we go and do something,
cos you should be dancing,
how the story goes, story goes,
everyone already knows

Hey baby, you, me, no three
you can take me dancing later,
don't tell me that,
you wanna play with your computer,
Just love me more,
cause you know I'm so much better,
than your secret secret lover,
Weibo? Facebook? Youtube? Twitter?

Do it, baby, do it, baby
(than your secret secret lover)
Do it, baby, do it, baby
(Come on over love me baby)
Do it, baby, do it, baby
(than your secret secret lover)
Do it, baby, do it, baby
(Weibo? Facebook? Youtube? Twitter?)

I am not your Princess
this ain't Super Mario World
(No! No! not your Material Girl!)
all you ever care about is your World of Warcraft
I can be an Angry Bird,
