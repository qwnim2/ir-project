The whispers in the morning of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now As I look in your eyes

I hold on to your body And feel each move you make
Your voice is warm and tender A love that I could not forsake

'Cause I am your lady And you are my man
Whenever you reach for me I'll do all that I can

Lost is how I'm feeling lying in your arms

When the world outsides's too much to take
That all ends when I'm with you Even though there may be times
It seems I'm far away Never wonder where I am
'Cause I am always by your side

We're heading for something Somewhere I've never been
Sometimes I am frightened But I'm ready to learn of the power of love

The sound of your heart beating Made it clear
Suddenly the feeling that I can't go on Is light years away
