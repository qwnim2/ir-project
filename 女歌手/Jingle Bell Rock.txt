Jingle bell Jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell swing and Jingle bell ring
Snowing and blowing a bushel of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell Jingle bell Jingle bell rock
Jingle bell chime and Jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing Jingle bell square
In the frosty air

What a bright time It's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time It's a swell time
To go gliding in a one horse sleigh

Giddy up Jingle horse Pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and mingle in jingle beat
That's the jingle bell rock
