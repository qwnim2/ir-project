我竟然沒有調頭　最殘忍那一刻
靜靜看你走　一點都不像我
原來人會變得溫柔　是透徹的懂了
愛情是流動的　不由人的　何必激動著要理由
相信你只是怕傷害我　不是騙我　很愛過誰會捨得
把我的夢搖醒了　宣佈幸福不會來了
用心酸微笑去原諒了　也翻越了　有昨天還是好的
但明天是自己的　開始懂了　快樂是選擇

(English Translation Lyrics)
Unexpectedly, I didn't turn around
during that cruel moment.
Quietly watching you leave
is so unlike me.
People actually can become gentle
is a shocking lesson.
Love flows,
cannot be molded.
Why so anxious for a reason?

I believe you were just afraid of hurting me.
Did not lie to me.
Who whose deeply loved before could?
Waking up my dreams.
Announcing happiness will not come.
Using a soured heart to smile and forgive
and transcend.
Having a yesterday is good enough.
But tomorrow will be mine alone.
Start to understand.
Happiness is choice.
