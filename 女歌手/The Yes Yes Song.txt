Late at night.Thoughts run wild
Dreams alive.Streets are empty
But you never thought that I'd
Be sleeples over you.Can't Believe
What yoy put me through.Hate to say
Thought you shauld know.I'm in trouble so bad
You're put my life on hold
You're playing hard to get, yes yes
So can you tell me more？yes yes
I'll make do with your. yes yes
Wake me up.When it's fine
When you're gone.I'll start over

Maybe cos the timing's wrong
I can't see through it all
I won't leave till you say
Late at night.Thoughts run wild
Dreams alive
Streets are empty(you're playing hard to get, yes yes)
Wake me up(tell me more than your yes yes)
When itsfine(I'll make do with your yes yes)
When you're gone(I'll make do with your, yes yes)
I'll start over(I'll make do with your yes！！)
