A smile upon your face　And feathers dance in grace
Your thousand kisses　This is our time and space
Forever as no pace　What if this is
A moment and a place　For lovers in a haste?
See what bliss is　If this is all we have
Tomorrow we must go　You should know

I don't care at all　wherever you want to go
I'll feel at home
No matter through the rise or fall
Through every bend　Until the end
Cause darling, I don't care at all
Whatever life has in store　I'll ask no more

No matter how tomorrow calls　Time made a vow
Forever now
Fire-flies in the air　The fever drawing near
Before the love strikes
Someone has lit the stars
And shadows mold the scars　In the moonlight
But only here we are　Unbroken driven far
From the first time
IF this is all we have　Tomorrow we must go

When we awake to the morning and break
The moment, then repent
And then confused, feeling, something's been bruised
We must go, but you'll know
